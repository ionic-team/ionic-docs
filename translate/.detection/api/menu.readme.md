# ion-menu

The Menu component is a navigation drawer that slides in from the side of the current view.
By default, it slides in from the left, but the side can be overridden.
The menu will be displayed differently based on the mode, however the display type can be changed to any of the available menu types.
The menu element should be a sibling to the root content element.
There can be any number of menus attached to the content.
These can be controlled from the templates, or programmatically using the MenuController.
