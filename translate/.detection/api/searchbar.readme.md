# ion-searchbar

Searchbars represent a text field that can be used to search through a collection. They can be displayed inside of a toolbar or the main content.

A Searchbar should be used instead of an input to search lists. A clear button is displayed upon entering input in the searchbar's text field. Clicking on the clear button will erase the text field and the input will remain focused. A cancel button can be enabled which will clear the input and lose the focus upon click.

## Keyboard Display

### Android

By default, tapping the input will cause the keyboard to appear with a magnifying glass icon on the submit button. You can optionally set the `inputmode` property to `"search"`, which will change the icon from a magnifying glass to a carriage return.

### iOS

By default, tapping the input will cause the keyboard to appear with the text "return" on a gray submit button. You can optionally set the `inputmode` property to `"search"`, which will change the text from "return" to "go", and change the button color from gray to blue. Alternatively, you can wrap the `ion-searchbar` in a `form` element with an `action` property. This will cause the keyboard to appear with a blue submit button that says "search".
