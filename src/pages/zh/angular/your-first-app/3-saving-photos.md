# Saving Photos to the Filesystem

We’re now able to take multiple photos and display them in a photo gallery on the second tab of our app. These photos, however, are not currently being stored permanently, so when the app is closed, they will be deleted.

## Filesystem API

Fortunately, saving them to the filesystem only takes a few steps. Begin by creating a new function, `savePicture()`, in the `PhotoService` class (`src/app/services/photo.service.ts`). We pass in the `cameraPhoto` object, which represents the newly captured device photo:

```typescript
private async savePicture(cameraPhoto: CameraPhoto) { }
```

We’ll use the Capacitor [Filesystem API](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/filesystem) to save the photo to the filesystem. To start, convert the photo to base64 format, then feed the data to the Filesystem’s `writeFile` function. Finally, make a call to getPhotoFile (which we will implement in a moment), which returns a Photo object.

```typescript
private async savePicture(cameraPhoto: CameraPhoto) {
  // Convert photo to base64 format, required by Filesystem API to save
  const base64Data = await this.readAsBase64(cameraPhoto);

  // Write the file to the data directory
  const fileName = new Date().getTime() + '.jpeg';
  await Filesystem.writeFile({
    path: fileName,
    data: base64Data,
    directory: FilesystemDirectory.Data
  });

  // Get platform-specific photo filepaths
  return await this.getPhotoFile(cameraPhoto, fileName);
}
```

`readAsBase64()` and `getPhotoFile()` are two helper functions we’ll define next. They are split into separate methods because they require a small amount of platform-specific (web vs. mobile) logic - more on that in a bit.  For now, implement them for running on the web:

```typescript
private async readAsBase64(cameraPhoto: CameraPhoto) {
  // Fetch the photo, read as a blob, then convert to base64 format
  const response = await fetch(cameraPhoto.webPath!);
  const blob = await response.blob();

  return await this.convertBlobToBase64(blob) as string;  
}

convertBlobToBase64 = (blob: Blob) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const reader = new FileReader;
  reader.onerror = reject;
  reader.onload = () => {
      resolve(reader.result);
  };
  reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
});
```

Obtaining the camera photo as base64 format on the web appears to be a bit trickier than on mobile. In reality, we’re just using built-in web APIs: [fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) as a neat way to read the file into blob format, then FileReader’s [readAsDataURl()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL) to convert the photo blob to base64.

`getPhotoFile()` is much simpler. As you’ll recall, we display each photo on the screen by setting each image’s source path (`src` attribute) in `tab2.page.html` to the webviewPath property. So, it gets set here:

```typescript
private async getPhotoFile(cameraPhoto: CameraPhoto, 
                           fileName: string): Promise<Photo> {
  return {
    filepath: fileName,
    webviewPath: cameraPhoto.webPath
  };
}
```

There we go! Each time a new photo is taken, it’s now automatically saved to the filesystem.
