# Ionic Angular 概览

`@ionic/angular` 将ionic核心体验与针对Angular开发者的工具和 API 结合起来。

## Angular 版本支持

Ionic支持 `Angular 6.0.0`以上版本。 As part of their upgrade strategy, Angular has built-in tooling to help automate upgrades and provide feedback to developers whenever changes to an API occurred. This reduces update friction and keeps the ecosystem in a evergreen state.

## Angular Tooling

With Ionic 4+, the official Angular stack for building an app and routing are used, so your app can fall in-line with the rest of the great Angular ecosystem. In cases where more opinionated features are needed, Ionic provides `@ionic/angular-toolkit`, which builds and integrates with the [official Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) and provides features that are specific to `@ionic/angular` apps.
