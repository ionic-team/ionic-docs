# Live Reload

One option that can boost productivity when building Ionic apps is **Live Reload** (or **live-reload**). When active, Live Reload will reload the browser or [Web View](/docs/building/webview) when changes in the app are detected. This is particularly useful for developing using hardware devices.

## Terms

Live Reload is a conflated term. With `ionic serve`, Live Reload refers to simply reloading the browser when changes are made. Live Reload can also be used with Capacitor and Cordova to provide the same experience on virtual and hardware devices, thus eliminating the need for re-deploying a native binary.

## Usage

Since live-reload requires the Web View to load your app from a URL hosted by your computer instead of simply reading files on the device, setting up live-reload for hardware devices can be tricky.

As with regular device deploys, you will need a cable to connect your device to your computer. The difference is the Ionic CLI configures the Web View to load your app from the dev server on your computer.

### Android

For Android devices, the Ionic CLI will automatically forward ports. This means you can use a `localhost` address and it will refer to your computer when loaded in the Web View, not the device.

The following all-in-one command will start a live-reload server on `localhost` and deploy the app to an Android device:

```shell
$ ionic cordova run android -l
```

### iOS

For iOS devices, port forwarding is not yet an option. This means you'll need to connect your device to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer and use an external address for the dev server.

> You can track [this issue](https://github.com/ionic-team/native-run/issues/20) for progress on iOS port forwarding with Ionic.

In some cases, the Ionic CLI won't know the address with which to configure the Web View, so you may be prompted to select one. Be sure to select the address of your computer on your Wi-Fi network.

The following all-in-one command will start a live-reload server on **all addresses** and deploy the app to an iOS device:

```shell
$ ionic cordova run ios -l --external
```

Remember, with the `--external` option, others on your Wi-Fi network will be able to access your app.

## Tips

- Use the `--device`, `--emulator`, and `--target` options to narrow down target devices. Use the `--list` option to list all targets. See usage in the [command docs](/docs/cli/commands/cordova-run).
- You can separate the dev server process and the deploy process by using `ionic serve` and the [`--livereload-url`](/docs/cli/commands/cordova-run#option-livereload-url) option of `ionic cordova run`.
- For Android, it is possible to configure [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) to setup the bridge over TCP such that subsequent deploys no longer need a USB cable.
