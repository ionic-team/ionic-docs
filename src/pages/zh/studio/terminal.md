# Terminal

Ionic Studio has an integrated terminal for running commands within an Ionic app.

## Introduction

> If you're new to the command line, you can check out [our blog post](https://ionicframework.com/blog/new-to-the-command-line/) on the basics.

The integrated terminal is a convenient way to perform a quick command line task without navigating folder structures or switching windows. The terminal defaults to the app directory.

Examples of what you can do with the integrated terminal:

- Ionic CLI commands
- Git operations
- File operations
- etc.

## Using the Terminal

To open the terminal, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd>, or click the plus sign in the terminal bar:

The integrated terminal uses your own configured shell. Configure this on macOS by setting the `SHELL` environment variable.

> For Windows, `powershell.exe` is used, and this is not yet configurable.
