# 并行限制

每个账户计划都有允许的并行构建的最大数量 (见 [详细计划信息](/pricing))。 这一限制是在不同应用程序的账户一级强制执行的。

当您触发构建时，在Appflow Dashboard 将会注意到，构建在处理之前可能有不同的状态：

* **Queued**：这意味着您的构建将排队等待下一个可用的运行程序。 Usually your build should not be in this state for more than few seconds.
* **Pending**: this means that you have reached your concurrent build limit and your build will continue when your current builds are completed.

After the build starts to be processed the statuses are:

* **Running**: the build is currently being processed. You can read the logs in the build details.
* **Successful**: the build terminated in a correct state.
* **Failed**: the build terminated in an incorrect state.

More concurrent builds can be added to your plan. If you have a Starter or Developer plan, you can get more builds by [upgrading plan](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/settings/billing). If you have a Teams or Business plan, please [contact us](https://ionic.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
