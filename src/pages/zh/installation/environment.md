# Environment Setup

To get started with Ionic Framework, the only requirement is a [Node & npm](#node-amp-npm) environment.

Of course, you will also need an editor. We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free, batteries-included text editor made by Microsoft.

## Node & npm

Almost all tooling for modern JavaScript projects is based in [Node.js](/docs/faq/glossary#node). The [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) has prebuilt installation packages for all platforms. We recommend selecting the LTS version to ensure best compatibility.

Node is bundled with [npm](/docs/faq/glossary#npm), the package manager for JavaScript.

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:

```shell
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

## Git

Although not required, the version control system [Git](/docs/faq/glossary#git) is highly recommended. First, install the command-line utility from the [download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads). For a GUI client, we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:

```shell
$ git --version
```
