# Ionic React Overview

`@ionic/react` combines the core Ionic experience with the tooling and APIs that are tailored to React Developers.

Currently in beta, you can try it now. First, install the Ionic CLI:

```shell
$ npm install ionic -g
```

 then run:

```shell
$ ionic start myApp --type=react
```

Now, start building an app using some of the [Ionic UI components](/docs/components).
