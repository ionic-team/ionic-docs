In the tutorial, you’ll use the Ionic Framework’s UI components to create a Login page and a Home page within an Ionic Angular app. With just a few lines of code, you’ll secure the Home page by adding Auth0 login/logout functionality using the Auth Connect native plugin.

## Aplicación Demo

For reference, a [complete demo app](https://github.com/ionic-team/demo-authconnect-auth0) is available that serves as a companion to the Auth0 article.

### Create Auth0 Account and Create App

Before integrating Auth Connect into your Ionic app, you’ll need to get Auth0 up and running. If you don’t have one already, create a [free Auth0 account](https://auth0.com) then head over to the Applications page and click the “Create Application” button. Give your new app a name, then choose “Native” for application type. Note the Domain and Client ID - you’ll need those later.

Next, choose your globally unique App Id, which is used both in Auth0 configuration as well as Cordova/Capacitor as well. Typically, this takes the form of “company-AppName” or reverse DNS style - “com.company.app.”

With that in hand, set the *Allowed Callback URLs*. After the app user signs into Auth0, this tells Auth Connect which page to redirect to in your app. Use the formula “uniqueId://page”, such as “company-AppName://callback.”

Similarly, set the *Allowed Logout URLs*, which tell Auth Connect where to redirect to after the user logs out of Auth0. Again, use the “uniqueId://page” format. Usually, the app would redirect the user to a login page, so consider using “company-AppName://login.”

Auth0 is now ready to use in your Ionic app.

### Install Auth Connect

Run the following command to install the Auth Connect plugin. For the `AUTH_URL_SCHEME` variable, use the globally unique App Id (ex: `com.company.app`) you decided on when configuring the Auth0 app above.

<native-ent-install plugin-id="auth-connect" variables="--variable AUTH_URL_SCHEME=com.company.app"></native-ent-install>

### Configure Auth Connect

It's recommended to create an `AuthenticationService` class that encapsulates Auth0 and Ionic Auth Connect’s login functionality.

Generate this class using the `ionic generate` command:

<command-line> <command-prompt>ionic generate service services/authentication</command-prompt> </command-line>

Extend the `IonicAuth` class, then configure all Auth0 details in the `IonicAuthOptions` object:

```typescript
import { IonicAuth, IonicAuthOptions } from '@ionic-enterprise/auth';

export class AuthenticationService extends IonicAuth {

constructor() {
    const auth0Config : IonicAuthOptions = {
        // the auth provider
        authConfig: 'auth0',
        // The platform which the app is running on
        platform: 'cordova',
        // client or application id for provider
        clientID: 'FILL_IN',
        // the discovery url for the provider
        // OpenID configuration
        discoveryUrl: 'FILL_IN',
        // the URI to redirect to after log in
        redirectUri: 'FILL_IN',
        // requested scopes from provider
        scope: 'openid offline_access email picture profile',
        // the audience, if applicable
        audience: 'FILL_IN',
        // the URL to redirect to after log out
        logoutUrl: 'FILL_IN',
        // The type of iOS webview to use. 'shared' will use a webview that can 
        // share session/cookies on iOS to provide SSO across multiple apps but
        // will cause a prompt for the user which asks them to confirm they want
        // to share site data with the app. 'private' uses a webview which will
        // not prompt the user but will not be able to share session/cookie data
        // either for true SSO across multiple apps.
        iosWebView: 'private'
    };

    super(auth0Config);
    }
}
```

Some of these `IonicAuthOptions` values are unique, and must be set based on your Auth0 app’s details:

* `platform`: Use “cordova” or “capacitor” accordingly.
* `clientID`: Your app’s Client ID.
* `discoveryUrl`: Consists of your Auth0 Domain plus “.well-known/openid-configuration”. Example: https://ionicorg.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
* `redirectUri`: The URI to redirect to after the user has logged in. Use the same AUTH_URL_SCHEME variable value (App Id) from when the Auth Connect plugin was installed. Example: com.company.app://callback
* `logoutUrl`: The URI to redirect to after the user has logged out. Example: com.company.app://login?logout=true

The Discovery URL can be found under Application Details -> Show Advanced Settings -> Endpoints tab:

The audience field comes from your custom API of choice &mdash; the API Audience field:
