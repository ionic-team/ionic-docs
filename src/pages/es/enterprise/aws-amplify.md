# AWS Amplify

Ionic integrates with AWS Amplify to give web developers a comprehensive library for creating and integrating backend resources into their apps quickly. Among the many features are authentication, analytics, push notifications, AI and ML cloud services, and storage.

## Installation

AWS Amplify is an entirely web-based SDK, so it works with either Cordova or Capacitor seamlessly.

First, install the Amplify SDK into your project:

<command-line> <command-prompt>npm install aws-amplify</command-prompt> </command-line>

Building an app with a web framework? Amplify has framework-specific packages available that offer UI components tailored for integration with your application. Check out [Angular](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/angular), [React](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/react), and [Vue](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/vue).

Continue on by following the [Ionic apps with AWS Amplify guide](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/tutorials/building-ionic-4-apps/) or the [Amplify JavaScript](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/start?platform=purejs) documentation.
