## Introduction

Pages and components are opened in a split view, bringing code and canvas together.

Compose mode features include:

* Quickly navigate and hone in on code via the canvas
* Immediate feedback upon even the smallest of changes
* Select from a rich library of elements right at your fingertips
* Reorganize the structure of your components simply by dragging them around
* Deep understanding of the elements that make up your components
* Focus on building your app, not fighting with the file tree
