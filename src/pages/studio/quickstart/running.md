Ionic Studio offers support for serving and running your app. You can serve your app in a browser window with preset viewports and full debugging support. You can also run your app on iOS simulators, Android emulators, and even hardware devices.

## Serving Your App

Serving your app will start a livereload server and display your app in a separate browser window.

## Running Your App

Running your app will prompt you to select a native target, which can be an emulator or hardware device plugged in to your computer. Since running your app will deploy to an actual native device, it does require some setup.

* For Android, see [Android Setup](/docs/installation/android)
* For iOS, see [iOS Setup](/docs/installation/ios)

Running your app can also make debugging more difficult than simply serving your app, but it is the only way to test the native functionality of your app.
