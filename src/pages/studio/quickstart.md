## Start a New App

Ionic apps can be created right in Ionic Studio.

You may have an existing Ionic 4 app you wish to use in Studio, in which case you may need to adapt this tutorial to your unique app.

To create a new Ionic project:

1. Open the New Project modal with **File** &raquo; **New Project**.
    ![Start a New Project with Studio](/docs/assets/img/studio/ss-new-project.png)
1. Supply a name for your app. This can be changed later.
1. Optionally supply a Bundle ID (aka Package ID), which is used to identify your app when published. It's okay to leave this blank for now.
1. Choose the **tabs** starter template for your app.
1. Click **Create Project**.
