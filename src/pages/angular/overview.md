# Ionic Angular Overview

Angular has always been at the center of what makes Ionic great. While the core components have been written to work as a standalone Web Component library, the `@ionic/angular` package makes integration with the Angular ecosystem a breeze.

## Angular Version Support

Ionic supports Angular 6.0.0 and up. It's recommended to update to the latest version of Angular when possible. Given both team's modern tooling approaches, updating should not be disruptive.

## Angular Tooling

With Ionic 4+, Angular's [official tooling](https://angular.io/cli) for building, bundling, and routing is used, so you get the most out of Angular's ecosystem and Ionic can focus on what we do best.

There isn't any non-standard tooling to invest in, so your skills will match what the rest of the Angular ecosystem is using. This also means that, in general, Ionic supports any new updates to a given framework immediately. No need to wait on us to support *version N* of Angular, it "Just Works."
