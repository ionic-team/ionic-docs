## File Tree Panel

The file tree panel on the left contains a list of all the files and directories in the app.

Right click on a file or directory to rename it, delete it, etc. Drag and drop to move files and directories is also supported.

### Search Project

App files can be searched using the search bar at the top of the file tree panel.

## Editor

The code editor itself behaves similar to other modern editors.

* Right click on symbols to **Go to Definition** or **Find all References** in TypeScript files
* **Find in File** with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> for macOS)
* Enjoy intelligent autocompletion of TypeScript code
* See TypeScript compile errors right inside the editor
* **Bracket matching** when the cursor is near bracket characters
