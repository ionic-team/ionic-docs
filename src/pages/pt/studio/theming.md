# Theming

Manage app themes to tweak look and feel.

The Ionic Framework docs have [great documentation](/docs/theming/basics) on theming Ionic apps.

## Theme Colors

The color generator within Ionic Studio automatically generates the CSS variables for the color, as well as the associated contrast, shade, and tint colors.

The changes are available for previewing in your own app in the [Compose](/docs/studio/compose) canvas.
