# Bem vindo ao Studio

Ionic Studio is a fast and easy app builder that helps teams build and prototype apps with minimal coding.

Studio is designed to integrate into an existing developer workflow, rather than replace it, enabling developers and architects to build visually *or* drop down to code using their favorite tools.

Studio fully supports bringing code back into the tool, something virtually unheard of in the app development tools market.

Studio is a desktop tool and requires a subscription, and is only for Ionic Angular 4.x+ projects. To get started, sign up below:
