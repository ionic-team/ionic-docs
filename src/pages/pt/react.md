## Familiar tooling

Ionic React projects are just like React projects, leveraging [react-dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) and with setup normally found in a [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) app. For [routing and navigation](/docs/react/navigation), React Router is used under the hood.
Compatible with React version 16.8 and above.

## More than mobile

Deploy your Ionic React projects to native iOS, Android, Electron, and the web as a Progressive Web App, using [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com), a modern native runtime. All with one shared codebase.

## Just React

At the end of the day, it's just React. Ionic React uses open web standards and built-in browser capabilities, so it's compatible with any of the millions of web libraries out there.
