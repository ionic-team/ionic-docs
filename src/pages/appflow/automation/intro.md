Ionic Appflow's automation features let you generate builds whenever you need them. Webhooks with secure, signed download URL's and build information are also easily configurable and updatable, ensuring your app gets in the necessary hands quickly and automatically.

Automations enable you and your team to utilize the full CI/CD powers of Appflow. You can create automations
that trigger [package builds](/docs/appflow/package/builds) and [deploy builds](/docs/appflow/deploy/builds)
every time your team checks in new code to a given branch and you can even configure the automations to use different
[environments](/docs/appflow/automation/environments#custom-environments) and [native configurations](/docs/appflow/package/native-configs)
so that you can build different versions of your app for development, staging, and production.
