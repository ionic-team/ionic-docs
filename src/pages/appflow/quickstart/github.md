If you are already using [GitHub](https://github.com/)
you can link your repository with your Appflow app to push code automatically.

## Prerequisites
In order to enable the integration with your Appflow app you will need an existing repository on
GitHub. 

## Setting up the Integration
Navigate to the `Git` section of the app settings tab in your app on the
Appflow Dashboard choose the GitHub tab. If this is your first time connecting
you'll need to click the `Connect` button.
Then you can choose the repository to link from the list of available repos.

When you link the repository a webhook will be created for the repository
and events will be sent to Appflow so that we have access to any commits you
push to your repository.
