## Deploy a new build to an app store

```bash
$ ionic package build <platform> <type> --security-profile=<name> --destination=<name>
```

  - `android` or `ios`
- `<type>`
  - `app-store` or `enterprise` for `ios`
  - `release` for `android`
- `--security-profile=<name>`
  - The selected profile must be a release or app store profile
- `--destination=<name>`

  - For an Android build it must be a Google Play Store destination


For more information about other `ionic package build` options, please refer to the [package build documentation](/docs/cli/commands/package-build).
