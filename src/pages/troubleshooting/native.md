# Native Errors

## Code Signing errors

```shell
Code Signing Error: Failed to create provisioning profile. The app ID "com.csform.ionic.yellow" cannot be registered to your development team. Change your bundle identifier to a unique string to try again. Code Signing Error: No profiles for 'com.csform.ionic.yellow' were found: Xcode couldn't find any iOS App Development provisioning profiles matching 'com.csform.ionic.yellow'. Code Signing Error: Code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 11.1'
```

Running an app on an iOS device requires a provisioning profile. If a provisioning profile has not been created yet follow these directions:

1. <strong>Set the [Package ID](/docs/reference/glossary#package-id).</strong>

    For Capacitor, open the `capacitor.config.json` file and modify the `appId` property.

    For Cordova, open the `config.xml` file and modify the `id` attribute of the root element, `<widget>`. See [the Cordova documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/#widget) for more information.

2. <strong>Open the project in <b>Xcode</b>.</strong>

    For Capacitor, run the following to open the app in Xcode:

    ```shell
    $ ionic capacitor open ios
    ```

    For Cordova, open Xcode. Use **File** &raquo; **Open** and locate the app. Open the app's `platforms/ios` directory.

3. <strong>In <b>Project navigator</b>, select the project root to open the project editor. Under the **Identity** section, verify that the Package ID that was set matches the Bundle Identifier.</strong>

4. <strong>In the same project editor, under the <b>Signing</b> section, ensure <b>Automatically manage signing</b> is enabled.</strong> Then, select a Development Team. Given a Development Team, Xcode will attempt to automatically prepare provisioning and signing.

## Xcode build error 65

```shell
Error: Error code 65 for command: xcodebuild with args: -xcconfig,/Users/ionitron/projects/my-project/platforms/ios/cordova/build-debug.xcconfig,-workspace,SC project.xcworkspace,-scheme,SC project,-configuration,Debug,-sdk,iphonesimulator,-destination,platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone X,build,CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR=/Users/ionitron/projects/my-project/platforms/ios/build/emulator,SHARED_PRECOMPS_DIR=/Users/ionitron/projects/my-project/platforms/ios/build/sharedpch
```

This error is an error code from Xcode that can be caused by provisioning issues or outdated cordova dependencies. To fix this error first make sure a provisioning profile has been generated using the above instructions and then try to [run the app from Xcode](/docs/developing/ios#running-with-xcode).

If this does not fix the error then run the following commands:

```shell
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf platform
npm i
ionic cordova platform add ios
ionic cordova prepare ios
ionic cordova build ios --prod
```

Once these commands have been ran a fresh build can be done.


## Clashing Google Play Services versions

```shell
Error: more than one library with package name com.google.android.gms
```

This error is caused by two separate plugins trying to use different versions of the `Google Play Services`. To fix this issue make sure you are running `cordova` version `7.1.0` or higher and `cordova-android` `6.3.0` or higher. To install latest `cordova` run:

```shell
$ npm install cordova@latest
```

and to update `cordova-android` run:

```shell
$ cordova platform update android
```


Plugins that depend on `Google Play Services` can now be updated to use the same version. For example, if `pluginA` uses version 11.0 and `pluginB` uses version 15.0 they can be updated to use the same version with the following snippet in the `config.xml` file:

```xml
<plugin name="pluginA" spec="npm">
  <variable name="PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION" value="15.0.0"/>
</plugin>
<plugin name="pluginB" spec="npm">
  <variable name="PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION" value="15.0.0" />
</plugin>
```
