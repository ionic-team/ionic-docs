Keyboard
========

The Keyboard plugin allows you to configure the keyboard behavior (show/hide) and display (sizing/visibility).

<native-ent-install plugin-id="keyboard" variables="" capacitor-slug="keyboard"></native-ent-install>

Usage
-----

```typescript
// Angular
import { Keyboard } from '@ionic-enterprise/keyboard/ngx';

...

constructor(private keyboard: Keyboard) {
  this.keyboard.setResizeMode('body');
  window.addEventListener('keyboardWillShow', () => console.log('keyboard showing'));
}

...

// ES2015+/TypeScript
import { Keyboard } from '@ionic-enterprise/keyboard';

Keyboard.setResizeMode('body');
window.addEventListener('keyboardWillShow', () => console.log('keyboard showing'));

...

// Vanilla JS
document.addEventListener('deviceready', () => {
  Keyboard.setResizeMode('body');
  window.addEventListener('keyboardWillShow', () => console.log('keyboard showing'));
});
```

Preferences
-----------

### KeyboardResize

> Boolean (true by default)

#### Possible values

*   `true`: Showing/hiding the keyboard will trigger some kind of resizing of the app (see KeyboardResizeMode)
*   `false`: Web will not be resized when the keyboard shows up.

```xml
<preference name="KeyboardResize" value="true" />
```

### KeyboardResizeMode

> String ('native' by default)

#### Possible values

*   `native`: The whole native webview will be resized when the keyboard shows/hides, it will affect the `vh` relative unit.
*   `body`: Only the html `<body>` element will be resized. Relative units are not affected, because the viewport does not change.
*   `ionic`: Only the html `ion-app` element will be resized. Only for ionic apps.

```xml
<preference name="KeyboardResizeMode" value="native" />
```
