# Ionic React Overview

`@ionic/react` combines the core Ionic experience with the tooling and APIs that are tailored to React Developers.

Currently in beta, you can try it now. First, install the Ionic CLI:

```shell
$ npm install ionic -g
```

then run:

```shell
$ ionic start myApp --type=react
```

Now, start building an app using some of the [Ionic UI components](/docs/components).

## React Version Support

Coming soon.

## React Tooling

Coming soon.

## Native Tooling

[Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com) is the official cross-platform app runtime used to make your `Ionic React` web app run natively on iOS, Android, Electron, and the web.

While there are no known technical limitations to using `Ionic React` with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) plugins, Capacitor is officially recommended. There are no plans to support a Cordova integration for `Ionic React` in the [Ionic CLI tooling](/docs/cli) at this time. For more details, please [see here](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/cordova).
