# Browser Support

Ionic's earliest goal was to make it easy to develop mobile apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because of this foundation in web technologies, Ionic can run anywhere the web runs — iOS, Android, browsers, Electron, PWAs, and more.

## Mobile

In pursuit of [platform continuity](/docs/intro/concepts#platform-continuity), Ionic fully supports and is well tested on the mobile platforms listed below:

| Platform    | Supported Versions |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| **Android** | 4.4+               |
| **iOS**     | 10+                |


> Check the [latest Android stats](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/) and the [latest iOS stats](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/) for up-to-date platform information.

## Desktop

Because Ionic is based on web technologies, it works just as well on desktop browsers as it does on mobile devices. For more information on desktop layouts, see [Cross Platform](/docs/building/cross-platform#desktop).

| Browser     | Supported |
| ----------- | --------- |
| **Chrome**  | ✔         |
| **Safari**  | ✔         |
| **Edge**    | ✔         |
| **Firefox** | ✔         |
| **IE**      | 11+       |


> Because Ionic is built with Stencil, see [Stencil's browser support](https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support) for a more detailed breakdown of support.
