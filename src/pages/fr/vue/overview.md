# Ionic Vue Overview

`@ionic/vue` combines the core Ionic experience with the tooling and APIs that are tailored to Vue Developers. Currently in beta.

## Vue Version Support

Coming soon.

## Vue Tooling

Coming soon.

## Native Tooling

[Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com) is the official cross-platform app runtime used to make your `Ionic Vue` web app run natively on iOS, Android, Electron, and the web.

While there are no known technical limitations to using `Ionic Vue` with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) plugins, Capacitor is officially recommended. There are no plans to support a Cordova integration for `Ionic Vue` in the [Ionic CLI tooling](/docs/cli) at this time. For more details, please [see here](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/cordova).
