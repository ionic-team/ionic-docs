For this destination you will need the following:

> **Prerequisite:** In order to build a binary that you can upload to the Apple App Store you will need a production signing certificate configured in App Flow, details [here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow/package/credentials#ios-credentials)


- **A name for instance of the Apple App Store destination**
    - Something that users will refer to this configuration as
- **Your Apple ID**
    - Does not need to be the owner account, but does need to be an account that can upload binaries and update the app
- **An App-specific password for your Apple ID**
    - To set up an App-Specific Password you need to enable Two Step Verification for you account.
    - Once that is enabled, sign in to [https://appleid.apple.com/](https://appleid.apple.com/) and in the Security Section there is an option to create/manage App-Specific Passwords
- **The Apple ID for the App from App Store Connect**
    - This is a value generated by Apple that is unique to your app. To find it :
        1. Log into App Store Connect: [https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
        2. Navigate to the App
        3. On the page for the App, Under General Information, is the Apple ID (should be all numbers)

- **(Optional) Team ID for the App from App Store Connect**
> Usually not required. But if you belong to multiple teams and are getting upload failures with error `1627`, fill out this field.
    - You can find in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership" target="_blank">Membership Details</a> page in your Apple Developer account Your team name for your Apple ID (if your account is in more than one team.)
    - In most cases the correct team will be used automatically without this field being specified, but rarely it cannot be determined and needs to be set.
