If you are already using [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org/) you can link your repository with your Appflow app to push code automatically.

## Prequisites

In order to enable the integration with your Appflow app you will need an existing repository on Bitbucket.

## Setting up the Integration

Navigate to the `Git` section of the app settings tab in your app on the Appflow Dashboard choose the Bitbucket Cloud tab. If this is your first time connecting you'll need to click the `Connect` button. Then you can choose the repository to link from the list of available repos.

When you link the repository a webhook will be created for the repository and events will be sent to Appflow so that we have access to any commits you push to your repository.

Only new commits will be shown. Historical commits prior to establishing a connection with BitBucket will not be displayed.
