# Browser Support

Ionic's original goal was to make it easy to develop mobile apps using web technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By using web technologies, Ionic is able to work across a wide range of devices, operating systems and browsers, all while using the same codebase.


## Mobile

Browser support was first centered around supporting mobile devices through [Platform Continuity](/docs/intro/concepts#platform-continuity), and has been heavily tested on the operating systems listed below:

- ### Android 4.4+
  - [Latest Android Stats](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/)
- ### iOS 10+
  - [Latest iOS Stats](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/)


## Desktop

Ionic not only works great on mobile devices, but since it's based on web technologies it works great on desktop browsers too.

- ### Chrome
- ### Safari
- ### Edge
- ### Firefox

For more information on desktop layouts, see [Cross Platform](/docs/building/cross-platform).
