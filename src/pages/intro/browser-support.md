# Browser Support

Ionic's original goal was to make it easy to develop mobile apps using web technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By using web technologies, Ionic is able to work across a wide range of devices, operating systems and browsers, all while using the same codebase.


## Mobile

In pursuit of [platform continuity](/docs/intro/concepts#platform-continuity), Ionic fully supports and is well tested on the mobile platforms listed below:

| Platform     | Supported Versions |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| **Android**  | 4.4+               |
| **iOS**      | 10+                |

> Check the [latest Android stats](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/) and the [latest iOS stats](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/) for up-to-date platform information.


## Desktop

Because Ionic is based on web technologies, it works just as well on desktop browsers as it does on mobile devices. For more information on desktop layouts, see [Cross Platform](/docs/building/cross-platform#desktop).


| Browser     | Supported |
| ----------- | --------- |
| **Chrome**  | ✔         |
| **Safari**  | ✔         |
