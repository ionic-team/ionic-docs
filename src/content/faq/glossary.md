  <section id="autoprefixer">
    <h3><a href="#autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a></h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> is a tool that adds vendor-specific-prefixes to hand-written Sass/CSS code. This ensures that standardized CSS rules you write will be applied across all supporting browsers. For example, instead of having to know every flexbox syntax used by various browsers, autoprefixer allows you to just write <code>display: flex;</code> and it'll automatically plug in the correct CSS.</p>

  <section id="bundling">
    <h3><a href="#bundling">Bundling</a></h3>

  <section id="cli">
    <h3><a href="#cli">CLI</a></h3>
    <p>A CLI, or command-line interface, is text-based interface for interacting with a program. The common command-line app for a Mac user is the Terminal app, and Windows users often use Command Prompt. The Ionic community often uses this term to refer to <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/cli/">Ionic's CLI</a>. Ionic's CLI can be used for a number of things, such as creating production builds of an app, running the development server, and accessing <a href="/pro/">Ionic services</a>.</p>

  <section id="decorators">
    <h3><a href="#decorators">Decorators</a></h3>
    <p>Decorators are expressions that return a function. They basically allow you to take an existing function, and extend its behavior. With TypeScript, you can also decorate <i>classes</i> and <i>parameters</i>. When you decorate a <strong>class</strong>, you are wrapping and extending the behavior of its constructor. In other words, the decorator will add some functionality when the constructor is called, and will then return the original constructor. When you decorate a <strong>parameter</strong>, you are wrapping the argument that gets passed in for that parameter. In other words, the decorator will add functionality when an argument is passed to the method, and then return the original argument.
