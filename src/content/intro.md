# What is Ionic Framework?

<!-- TOC goes here -->

<p class="intro" markdown="1">
Ionic Framework is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
</p>
<p class="intro" markdown="1">
Ionic Framework is focused on the frontend user experience, or UI interaction of an app (controls, interactions, gestures, animations). It’s easy to learn, and integrates nicely with other libraries or frameworks, such as Angular, or can be used standalone without a frontend framework.
</p>
<p class="intro" markdown="1">
Currently, Ionic Framework has official integration with <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, but support for <strong>Vue</strong> and <strong>React</strong> are in development. If you’d like to learn more about Ionic Framework before diving in, we [created a video](#) to walk you through the basics.
</p>

## Goals

### Cross-platform

Build and deploy apps that work across multiple platforms, such as native iOS, Android, desktop, and the web as a Progressive Web App - all with one codebase. Write once, run anywhere.

### Web Standards-based

Ionic Framework is intentionally built on top of reliable, standardized web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because of this, Ionic apps are future proofed by default, and cannot be controlled by any one organization.

### Beautiful Design

Clean, simple, and functional. Ionic Framework is designed to work and display beautifully out-of-the-box across all platforms. Start with pre-designed components, typography, interactive paradigms, and a gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme.

### Simplicity

Ionic Framework is built with simplicity in mind, so that creating Ionic apps enjoyable, easy to learn, and accessible to just about anyone with web development familiarity.

## License

Ionic Framework is completely a free and open source project, released under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT license</a>. This means you can use it in personal or commercial projects for free. For example, MIT is the same license used by such popular projects as jQuery and Ruby on Rails.

This website and documentation content (found in the <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-site" target="_blank">ionic-site</a> repo) is licensed under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">Apache 2 license</a>.


## Ionic CLI

The official [Ionic CLI](#), or Command Line Interface, is a tool that quickly scaffolds Ionic apps and provides a number of helpful commands to Ionic developers. In addition to installing and updating Ionic, the CLI comes with a built-in development server, build and debugging tools, and much more. If you are an [Ionic Pro](#ionic-pro) member, the CLI can be used to export code and even interact with your account programmatically.

##  Framework Compatibility

While versions 1-3 of Ionic Framework were deeply coupled to Angular, version 4 was re-architected to not only integrate with Angular, but to also work well with other JS libraries and frameworks (or even no framework).

### JavaScript

Todo: Talk about Ionic Framework’s new support for vanilla JS (no framework required).

### Angular

Todo: Talk about Ionic Framework's Angular integration.

### Stencil

Todo: Talk about Ionic Framework being used with Stencil.

### Future Support

Support for other frameworks, such as Vue and React, are actively being developed. To request support for others, please create an issue on our GitHub page.

## Ionic Framework v4+

Ionic Framework v4 is a major advance in the underlying technology and capabilities of the project, with a focus on performance, compatibility, and overall extensibility. Although v4 still integrates deeply with Angular, it’s now also framework-agnostic, meaning it can work with any other JS framework (Vue, React, Preact, etc), or no framework at all.

[Write more about what v4 is all about: Performance/startup times, size, web standards, etc.]

## Ionic Pro

To take Ionic Framework apps even further, we also offer a commercial app platform called <a href="https://ionicframework.com/pro" target="_blank">Ionic Pro</a>. Ionic (the company) makes money by charging a subscription for Ionic Pro (among other comercial products), which <strong>is entirely optional and separate from the open source Framework.</strong>

Ionic Pro helps developers and teams monitor and track runtime errors, compile native app builds, and deploy live code updates to Ionic apps from a centralized dashboard. Pro requires an Ionic Account and comes with a free "Starter" plan for those interested in playing around with some of its features. Optional upgrades to paid plans for more advanced capabilities and scale are available as well.

## Ecosystem

<!-- Ionic Framework was originally built by <a href="#" target="_blank">Ben Sperry</a>, <a href="#" target="_blank">Adam Bradley</a>, and <a href="#" target="_blank">Max Lynch</a>. After releasing an alpha preview in 2013, adoption of the framework quickly grew beyond their expectations, and a core team was formed to work on it full-time. -->

Ionic Framework is actively developed and maintained full-time by a core team, and its ecosystem is guided by an international community of developers and contributors fueling its growth and adoption. Developers and companies small and large use Ionic to build and ship amazing apps that run everywhere.
