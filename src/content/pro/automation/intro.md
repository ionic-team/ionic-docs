# Automation

Ionic Pro's automation features let you generate builds whenever you need them. Webhooks with secure, signed download URL's and build information are also easily configurable and updatable, ensuring your app gets in the necessary hands quickly and automatically.

## Automation Types

Automations can be used to create both Deploy (web) and Package builds, as well as manage channel assignments for in-app live updates ([Build type docs](/docs/pro/builds/intro)). 

## Before Starting

To take advantage of the full power of native build automations, an app must be configured to use [Package Builds](/docs/pro/package/intro), as this feature is leveraged to deliver native code.
