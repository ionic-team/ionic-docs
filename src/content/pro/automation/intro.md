# Automation

Ionic Pro's automation features let you generate deliverable native builds whenever you need them. Webhooks with secure, signed download URL's and build information are also easily configurable and updatable, ensuring your app gets in the necessary hands quickly and automatically.


## Before Starting

To take advantage of the full power of automations, an app must be configured to use [Package Builds](/docs/pro/package/intro), as this feature is leveraged to deliver native code.
