# Packaging Native Binaries

Ionic Appflow's Package feature makes it easy to build native app binaries for iOS and Android in the cloud. Perfect for automating binary builds and for developers using Windows that want to build iOS apps.

## Getting Started

To start, you'll need to upload iOS and/or Android certificate profiles to enable Package to build your app in the cloud.

Get started with security profiles [here](/docs/pro/package/credentials).

## Performing a Build

Click on the **Code** tab of your App, you should be at your **Builds** list. Click on the **Package** button for the Build you'd like to get a Native binary for.

In the Package GUI you'll be able to choose the type of Build you want to perform, and the Cert you'd like to use. You'll then be taken to the History tab while the build completes. After the build completes, click Download and you'll get your native binary!

## Automating Builds

If you'd like package builds to be generated automatically, check out the automation docs [here](/docs/pro/automation/intro).
