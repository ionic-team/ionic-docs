# Browser Support

<p class="intro" markdown="1">
Ionic's original goal was to make it easy to develop mobile apps using web technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By using web technologies, Ionic is able to work across a wide range of devices, operating systems and browsers, all while using the same codebase.
</p>


## Mobile

Browser support was first centered around supporting mobile devices through [Platform Continuity](/docs/intro/concepts#platform-continuity), and has been heavily tested on the operating systems listed below:

- ### Android 4.4+
  - [Latest Android Stats](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/)
- ### iOS 10+
  - [Latest iOS Stats](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/)


## Desktop

Ionic not only works great on mobile devices, but since it's based on web technologies it works great on desktop browsers too.

- ### Chrome
- ### Safari
- ### Edge
- ### Firefox

For more information on desktop layouts, see [Cross Platform](/docs/building/cross-platform).
