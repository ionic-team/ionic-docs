# Testing

<p class="intro" markdown="1">
When an `@ionic/angular` application is generated using the Ionic CLI, it is automatically set up to unit test the application using Jasmine. This is the same setup that is used by the Angular CLI. Refer to the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing" target="_blank">Angular Testing Guide</a> for detailed information on unit testing Angular applications.
</p>

## Testing Principles

When testing the application, it is best to keep in mind that the goal of testing is not to verify that the code is correct but is to find problems with the code so bugs can be resolved earlier in the development cycle when fixes are less expensive. This is a subtle but important distinction. 

If we set out to prove that the code is correct, we are more likely to stick to the happy path through the code. If we set out to find problems, we are more likely to more fully exercise the code and find the bugs that are lurking there.

## General Testing Structure

Unit tests are contained in `spec` files with one `spec` file per entity (component, page, service, pipe, etc.). The `spec` files live side-by-side with and are named after the source that they are testing. For example, if the project has a service called WeatherService, the code for it will be in a file named `weather.service.ts` with the tests in a file named `weather.service.spec.ts`. Both of those files will be in the same folder.

The `spec` files themselves contain a single `describe` call that defines that overall test. Nested within it are other `describe` calls that define major areas of functionality. Each `describe` call can contain setup and teardown code (generally handled via `beforeEach` and `afterEach` calls), more `describe` calls forming a hierarchical breakdown of functionality, and `it` calls which define individual test cases.

The `describe` and `it` calls also contain a descriptive text label. In well-formed tests, the `describe` and `it` calls combine with their labels to perform proper phrases and the full label for the each test case, formed by combining the `describe` and `it` labels, creates a full sentence.

For example:

```TypeScript
describe('Calculation', () => {
  describe('divide', () => {
    it('calculates 4 / 2 properly' () => {});
    it('cowardly refuses to divide by zero' () => {});
    ...
  });

  describe('multiply', () => {
    ...
  });
});
```

The outer `describe` call states that the `Calculation` service is being tested, the inner `describe` calls state exactly what functionality is being tested, and the `it` calls state what the test cases are. When run the full label for each test case is a sentence that makes sense (Calculation divide cowardly refuses to divide by zero).

## Pages and Components

Pages are just Angular components. Thus, pages and components are both tested using <a href="https://angular.io/guide/testing#component-test-basics">Angular's Component Testing</a> guidelines.

Since pages and components contain both TypeScript code and HTML template markup it is possible to perform both component class testing and component DOM testing. When a page is created, the template test that is generated looks like this:

```TypeScript
import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
import { async, ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';

import { TabsPage } from './tabs.page';

describe('TabsPage', () => {
  let component: TabsPage;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<TabsPage>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [TabsPage],
      schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
    }).compileComponents();
  });

  beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(TabsPage);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
  });

  it('should create', () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

When doing component class testing, the component object is accessed using the component object defined via `component = fixture.componentInstance;`. This is an instance of the component class. When doing DOM testing, the `fixture.nativeElement` property is used. This is the actual `HTMLElement` for the component, which allows the test to use standard HTML API methods such as `HTMLElement.querySelector` in order to examine the DOM.

## Services

Services often fall into one of two broad categories: utility services that perform calculations and other operations, and data services that perform primarily HTTP operations and data manipulation.

### Basic Service Testing

The suggested way to test most services is to instantiate the service and manually inject mocks for any dependency the service has. This way, the code can be tested in isolation.

Let's say that there is a service with a method that takes an array of timecards and calculates net pay. Let's also assume that the tax calculations are handled via another service that the current services depends on. This payroll service could be tested as such:

```TypeScript
import { PayrollService } from './payroll.service';

describe('PayrollService', () => {
  let service: PayrollService;
  let taxServiceSpy;

   beforeEach(() => {
     taxServiceSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj('TaxService', {
       federalIncomeTax: 0,
       stateIncomeTax: 0,
       socialSecurity: 0,
       medicare: 0
     });
     service = new PayrollService(taxServiceSpy);
   });

   describe('net pay calculations', () => {
     ...
   });
});
```

This allows the test to control the values returned by the various tax calculations via mock setup such as `taxServiceSpy.federalIncomeTax.and.returnValue(73.24)`. This allows the "net pay" tests to be independent of the tax calculation logic. When the tax codes change, only the tax service related code and tests need to change. The tests for the net pay can continue to operate as they are since these tests do not care how the tax is calculated, just that the value is applied properly.

The scaffolding that is used when a service is generated via `ionic g service name` uses Angular's testing utilities and sets up a testing module. Doing so is not strictly necessary. That code may be left in, however, allowing the service to be built manually or injected as such:

```TypeScript
import { TestBed, inject } from '@angular/core/testing';

import { PayrollService } from './payroll.service';
import { TaxService } from './tax.service';

describe('PayrolService', () => {
  let taxServiceSpy;

  beforeEach(() => {
    taxServiceSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj('TaxService', {
       federalIncomeTax: 0,
       stateIncomeTax: 0,
       socialSecurity: 0,
       medicare: 0
     });
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      providers: [
        PayrollService,
        { provide: TaxService, useValue: taxServiceSpy }
      ]
    });
  });

  it('does some test where it is injected',
    inject([PayrollService], (service: PayrollService) => {
      expect(service).toBeTruthy();
    })
  );

  it('does some test where it is manually built', () => {
    const service = new PayrollService(taxServiceSpy);
    expect(service).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Testing HTTP Data Services

Most services that perform HTTP operations will use Angular's HttpClient service in order to perform those operations. For such tests it is suggested to use Angular's `HttpClientTestingModule`. For detailed documentation of this module, please see Angular's <a href="https://angular.io/guide/http#testing-http-requests" target="_blank">Angular's Testing HTTP requests</a> guide.

This basic setup for such a test looks like this:

```TypeScript
import {
  HttpBackend,
  HttpClient
} from '@angular/common/http';
import {
  HttpTestingController,
  HttpClientTestingModule
} from '@angular/common/http/testing';
import { TestBed, inject } from '@angular/core/testing';

import { IssTrackingDataService } from './iss-tracking-data.service';

describe('IssTrackingDataService', () => {
  let httpClient: HttpClient;
  let httpTestingController: HttpTestingController;
  let issTrackingDataService: IssTrackingDataService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [HttpClientTestingModule],
      providers: [
        IssTrackingDataService
      ]
    });

    httpClient = TestBed.get(HttpClient);
    httpTestingController = TestBed.get(HttpTestingController);
    issTrackingDataService = new IssTrackingDataService(httpClient);
  });

  it('exists', inject([IssTrackingDataService], (service: IssTrackingDataService) => {
      expect(service).toBeTruthy();
  }));

  describe('location', () => {
    it('gets the location of the ISS now', () => {
      issTrackingDataService.location().subscribe(x => {
        expect(x).toEqual({ longitude: -138.1719, latitude: 44.4423 });
      });
      const req = httpTestingController.expectOne(
        'http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json'
      );
      expect(req.request.method).toEqual('GET');
      req.flush({
        iss_position: { longitude: '-138.1719', latitude: '44.4423' },
        timestamp: 1525950644,
        message: 'success'
      });
      httpTestingController.verify();
    });
  });
});
```

## Pipes

A pipe is like a service with a specifically defined interface. It is a class that contains one public method, `transform`, which manipulates the input value (and other optional arguments) in order to create the output that is rendered on the page. To test a pipe: instantiate the pipe, call the transform method, and verify the results.

As a simple example, let's look at a pipe that takes a `Person` object and formats the name. For the sake of simplicity, let's say a `Person` consists of an `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `middleInitial`. The requirements for the pipe are to print the name as "Last, First M." handling situations where a first name, last name, or middle initial do not exist. Such a test might look like this:

```TypeScript
import { NamePipe } from './name.pipe';

import { Person } from '../../models/person';

describe('NamePipe', () => {
  let pipe: NamePipe;
  let testPerson: Person;

  beforeEach(() => {
    pipe = new NamePipe();
    testPerson = {
      id: 42,
      firstName: 'Douglas',
      lastName: 'Adams',
      middleInitial: 'N'
    };
  });

  it('exists', () => {
    expect(pipe).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('formats a full name properly', () => {
    expect(pipe.transform(testPerson)).toBeEqual('Adams, Douglas N.');
  });

  it('handles having no middle initial', () => {
    delete testPerson.middleInitial;
    expect(pipe.transform(testPerson)).toBeEqual('Adams, Douglas');
  });

  it('handles having no first name', () => {
    delete testPerson.firstName;
    expect(pipe.transform(testPerson)).toBeEqual('Adams N.');
  });

  it('handles having no last name', () => {
    delete testPerson.lastName;
    expect(pipe.transform(testPerson)).toBeEqual('Douglas N.');
  });
});
```

It is also beneficial to exercise the pipe via DOM testing in the components and pages that utilize the pipe.

## Using Mocks

It is usually best to test a code module in isolation. To do this, use mock objects (which Jasmine calls "spies") in place of dependencies. When a mock object is used, the test can control the values returned by calls to that dependency, making the current test independent of changes made to the dependency. This also makes test setup easier, allowing the test to only be concerned with the code within the module under test.

Using mocks also allows the test to query the mock to determine it it was called and how it was called via the `toHaveBeenCalled*` set of functions. Tests should be as specific as possible with these functions, favoring calls to `toHaveBeenCalledTimes` over calls to `toHaveBeenCalled` when testing that a method has been called. That is `expect(mock.foo).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)` is better than `expect(mock.foo).toHaveBeenCalled()`. The opposite advice should be followed when testing that something has not been called (`expect(mock.foo).not.toHaveBeenCalled()`).

There are two common ways to create mock objects in Jasmine.  Mock objects can be constructed from scratch using `jasmine.createSpy` and `jasmine.createSpyObj` or spies can be installed onto existing objects using `spyOn()` and `spyOnProperty()`.

### Using `jasmine.createSpy` and `jasmine.createSpyObj`

`jasmine.createSpyObj` creates a full mock object from scratch with a set of mock methods defined on creation. This is useful in that it is very simple. Nothing needs to be constructed or injected into the test. This disadvantage of using this function is that it allows the creation of objects that may not match the real objects.

`jasmine.createSpy` is similar but it creates a stand-alone mock function.

### Using `spyOn()` and `spyOnProperty()`

`spyOn()` installs the spy on an existing object. The advantage to using this technique is that if an attempt is made to spy on a method that does not exist on the object, an exception is raised. This prevents the test from mocking methods that do not exist. The disadvantage is that the test needs a fully formed object to begin with, which may increase the amount of test setup required.

`spyOnProperty()` is similar with the difference being that it spies on a property and not a method.
