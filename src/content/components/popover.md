# ion-popover

A Popover is a dialog that appears on top of the current page. It can be used for anything, but generally it is used for overflow actions that don't fit in the navigation bar.

### Creating

Popovers can be created using a [Popover Controller](../../popover-controller/PopoverController). They can be customized by passing popover options in the popover controller's create method.

### Presenting

To present a popover, call the `present` method on a popover instance. In order to position the popover relative to the element clicked, a click event needs to be passed into the options of the the `present` method. If the event is not passed, the popover will be positioned in the center of the viewport.
