# ion-avatar

Avatars are circular components that usually wrap an image or icon. They can be used to represent a person or an object.

Avatars can be used by themselves or inside of any element. If placed inside of an `ion-chip` or `ion-item`, the avatar will resize to fit the parent component. To position an avatar on the left or right side of an item, set the slot to `start` or `end`, respectively.
