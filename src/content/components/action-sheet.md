# ion-action-sheet

An Action Sheet is a dialog that displays a set of options. It appears on top of the app's content, and must be manually dismissed by the user before they can resume interaction with the app. Destructive options are made obvious in `ios` mode. There are multiple ways to dismiss the action sheet, including tapping the backdrop or hitting the escape key on desktop.

### Creating

An action sheet can be created by the [Action Sheet Controller](../../action-sheet-controller/ActionSheetController) from an array of `buttons`, with each button including properties for its `text`, and optionally a `handler` and `role`. If a handler returns `false` then the action sheet will not be dismissed. An action sheet can also optionally have a `title`, `subTitle` and an `icon`.

### Buttons

A button's `role` property can either be `destructive` or `cancel`. Buttons without a role property will have the default look for the platform. Buttons with the `cancel` role will always load as the bottom button, no matter where they are in the array. All other buttons will be displayed in the order they have been added to the `buttons` array. Note: We recommend that `destructive` buttons are always the first button in the array, making them the top button. Additionally, if the action sheet is dismissed by tapping the backdrop, then it will fire the handler from the button with the cancel role.
