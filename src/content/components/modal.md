# ion-modal

A Modal is a dialog that appears on top of the app's content, and must be dismissed by the app before interaction can resume. It is useful as a select component when there are a lot of options to choose from, or when filtering items in a list, as well as many other use cases.


### Creating

Modals can be created using a [Modal Controller](../../modal-controller/ModalController). They can be customized by passing modal options in the modal controller's create method.
