# ion-thumbnail

Thumbnails are square components that usually wrap an image or icon. They can be used to make it easier to display a group of larger images or provide a preview of the full-size image.

Thumbnails can be used by themselves or inside of any element. If placed inside of an `ion-item`, the thumbnail will resize to fit the parent component. To position a thumbnail on the left or right side of an item, set the slot to `start` or `end`, respectively.
