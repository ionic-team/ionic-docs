# ion-toast

A Toast is a subtle notification commonly used in modern applications. It can be used to provide feedback about an operation or to display a system message. The toast appears on top of the app's content, and can be dismissed by the app to resume user interaction with the app.

### Creating

All of the toast options should be passed in the create method. The message to display should be passed in the `message` property. The `showCloseButton` option can be set to true in order to display a close button on the toast. See the properties below for all available options.

### Positioning

Toasts can be positioned at the top, bottom or middle of the viewport. The position can be passed upon creation. The possible values are `top`, `bottom` and `middle`. If the position is not specified, the toast will be displayed at the bottom of the viewport.

### Dismissing

The toast can be dismissed automatically after a specific amount of time by passing the number of milliseconds to display it in the `duration` of the toast options. If `showCloseButton` is set to true, then the close button will dismiss the toast. To dismiss the toast after creation, call the `dismiss()` method on the instance.
