# ion-route-redirect

A redirect router can only be used in the scope of `ion-router` as a direct children of it.

This route has only two configurable values:
 - `from`
 - `to`

Their meaning is obvious under the context of a redirection, that ocurrs `from` a given URL `to` another given URL.

In other for a redirection to occurs the `from` path needs to be an exact match of the navigated URL.

## Redirection evaluation

An arbitrary number of redirect routes can be defined inside an `ion-router`, but only one can match.

Also, a redirection route WILL never redirect to another redirection router, since this could lead to infinity loops.

Let's say we have this two redirection rules:

```html
<ion-router>
  <ion-route-redirect from="/admin" to="/login"/>
  <ion-route-redirect from="/login" to="/admin"/>
</ion-router>
```

And the user navigates to `/admin`. The router will then redirect to `/login` and stop there.

It WILL NOT never evalute more than one redirection rule in a roll.


## Examples

### Simple path

```html
<ion-route-redirect from="/admin" to="/login">
```

This route will apply (redirect) when the user navigates to: `/admin` but it will NOT apply if the user navigates to `/admin/posts`.

In order to match any subpath of admin, the wildcard character (`*`) needs to be used.

```html
<ion-route-redirect from="/admin/*" to="/login">
```

### Redirect all routes to login

Redirection routes can work as guards, since that can prevent user to navigate to areas to your application based in a given condition, for example, if the user is authenticated or not.


```tsx
{!this.isLoggedIn &&
  <ion-route-redirect from="*" to="/login"/> }
```

A router can be added and removed dynamically to redirect (or guard) some routes from being accessed.

Another approach is to modify the value of `to`, since given `to` the value of `null` or `undefined` makes disables the redirection.

```tsx
 <ion-route-redirect from="*" to={this.isLoggedin ? undefined : '/login'}/>
```

## Properties

#### from

string

A redirect route, redirects "from" a URL "to" another URL. This property is that "from" URL.
It needs to be an exact match of the navigated URL in order to apply.

The path specified in this value is always an absolute path, even if the initial `/` slash
is not specified.


#### to

string

A redirect route, redirects "from" a URL "to" another URL. This property is that "to" URL.
When the defined `ion-route-redirect` rule matches, the router will redirect to the path
specified in this property.

The value of this property is always an absolute path inside the scope of routes defined in
`ion-router` it can't be used with another router or to perfom a redirection to a different domain.

Note that this is a virtual redirect, it will not cause a real browser refresh, again, it's
a redirect inside the context of ion-router.

When this property is not specified or his value is `undefined` the whole redirect route is noop,
even if the "from" value matches.


## Attributes

#### from

string

A redirect route, redirects "from" a URL "to" another URL. This property is that "from" URL.
It needs to be an exact match of the navigated URL in order to apply.

The path specified in this value is always an absolute path, even if the initial `/` slash

#### to

string

A redirect route, redirects "from" a URL "to" another URL. This property is that "to" URL.
When the defined `ion-route-redirect` rule matches, the router will redirect to the path
specified in this property.

The value of this property is always an absolute path inside the scope of routes defined in
`ion-router` it can't be used with another router or to perfom a redirection to a different domain.

Note that this is a virtual redirect, it will not cause a real browser refresh, again, it's

When this property is not specified or his value is `undefined` the whole redirect route is noop,
even if the "from" value matches.


## Events

#### ionRouteRedirectChanged

Internal event that fires when any value of this rule is added/removed from the DOM,
or any of his public properties changes.

`ion-router` captures this event in order to update his internal registry of router rules.
