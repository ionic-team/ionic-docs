# ion-spinner

The Spinner component provides a variety of animated SVG spinners. Spinners are visual indicators that the app is loading content or performing another process that the user needs to wait on.

The default spinner to use is based on the platform. The default spinner for `ios` is `"lines"`, and the default for `android` is `"crescent"`. If the platform is not `ios` or `android`, the spinner will default to `crescent`. If the `name` property is set, then that spinner will be used instead of the platform specific spinner.
