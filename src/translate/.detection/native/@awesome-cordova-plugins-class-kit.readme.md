Plugin for using Apple's ClassKit framework.


Prerequisites:
Only works with Xcode 9.4 and iOS 11.4. Your Provisioning Profile must include the ClassKit capability. Read more about how to Request ClassKit Resources (https://developer.apple.com/contact/classkit/) in here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/classkit/enabling_classkit_in_your_app.
Also note that you can’t test ClassKit behavior in Simulator because Schoolwork isn’t available in that environment.
