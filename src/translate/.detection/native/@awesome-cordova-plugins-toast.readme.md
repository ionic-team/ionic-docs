This plugin allows you to show a native Toast (a little text popup) on iOS, Android and WP8. It's great for showing a non intrusive native notification which is guaranteed always in the viewport of the browser.

Requires Cordova plugin: `cordova-plugin-x-toast`. For more info, please see the [Toast plugin docs](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin).
