This plugin implements a File API allowing read/write access to files residing on the device.

The File class implements static convenience functions to access files and directories.

Example:
```
import { File } from '@awesome-cordova-plugins/file/ngx';

constructor(private file: File) { }

...

this.file.checkDir(this.file.dataDirectory, 'mydir').then(_ => console.log('Directory exists')).catch(err =>
  console.log('Directory doesn't exist'));

```

 This plugin is based on several specs, including : The HTML5 File API http: //www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/
 The (now-defunct) Directories and System extensions Latest: http: //www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-file-system-api-20120417/
 Although most of the plugin code was written when an earlier spec was current: http:
  //www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-file-system-api-20110419/ It also implements the FileWriter spec : http:
