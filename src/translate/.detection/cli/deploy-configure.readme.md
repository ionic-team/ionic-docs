This command overrides configuration for the Appflow Deploy plugin (`cordova-plugin-ionic`) in Capacitor projects.

For Capacitor projects, if the plugin is already installed, it overrides the configuration variables in the native projects.

For Cordova projects this is not implemented because it is better to reinstall the plugin with the different parameters and let Cordova deal with the changes.
