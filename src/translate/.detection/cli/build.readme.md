`ionic build` will perform an Ionic build, which compiles web assets and prepares them for deployment.

`ionic build` uses the Angular CLI. Use `ng build --help` to list all Angular CLI options for building your app. See the `ng build` [docs](https://angular.io/cli/build) for explanations. Options not listed below are considered advanced and can be passed to the `ng` CLI using the `--` separator after the Ionic CLI arguments. See the examples.
