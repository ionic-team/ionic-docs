This command will initialize an Ionic app within the current directory. Usually, this means an `ionic.config.json` file is created. If used within a multi-app project, the app is initialized in the root `ionic.config.json`.

`ionic init` will prompt for a project name and then proceed to determine the type of your project. You can specify the `name` argument and `--type` option to provide these values via command-line.

If the `--multi-app` flag is specified, this command will initialize your project as a multi-app project, allowing for apps within monorepos and unconventional repository structures. See the multi-app [docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/configuration#multi-app-projects) for details. Once a multi-app project is initialized, you can run `ionic init` again within apps in your project to initialize them.
