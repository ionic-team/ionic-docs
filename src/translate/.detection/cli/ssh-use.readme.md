This command modifies the SSH configuration file (**~/.ssh/config**) to set an active private key for the **git.ionicjs.com** host. Read more about SSH configuration by running the `man ssh_config` command or by visiting online man [pages](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config).

Before making changes, `ionic ssh use` will print a diff and ask for permission to write the file.
