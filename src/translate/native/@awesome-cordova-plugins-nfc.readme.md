The NFC plugin allows you to read and write NFC tags. You can also beam to, and receive from, other NFC enabled devices.

Use to
- read data from NFC tags
- write data to NFC tags
- send data to other NFC enabled devices
- receive data from NFC devices

This plugin uses NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) for maximum compatibilty between NFC devices, tag types, and operating systems.
