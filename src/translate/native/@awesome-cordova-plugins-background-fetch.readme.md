iOS Background Fetch Implementation. See: https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplication#1657399
iOS Background Fetch is basically an API which wakes up your app about every 15 minutes (during the user's prime-time hours) and provides your app exactly 30s of background running-time. This plugin will execute your provided callbackFn whenever a background-fetch event occurs. There is no way to increase the rate which a fetch-event occurs and this plugin sets the rate to the most frequent possible value of UIApplicationBackgroundFetchIntervalMinimum -- iOS determines the rate automatically based upon device usage and time-of-day (ie: fetch-rate is about ~15min during prime-time hours; less frequently when the user is presumed to be sleeping, at 3am for example).
