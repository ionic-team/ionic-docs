This plugin exposes information on the status of various accessibility features of mobile operating systems, including, for example, whether a screen reader is running, invert colors is enabled, and the preferred scaling for text.
It also allows an application to send a string to be spoken by the screen reader, or a command to stop the screen reader from speaking.
