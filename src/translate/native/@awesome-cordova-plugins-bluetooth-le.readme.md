This plugin has the most complete implementation for interacting with Bluetooth LE devices on Android, iOS and partially Windows.
It's a wrap around [randdusing/cordova-plugin-bluetoothle](https://github.com/randdusing/cordova-plugin-bluetoothle/blob/master/readme.md) cordova plugin for Ionic.
It supports peripheral **and** central modes and covers most of the API methods available on Android and iOS.
