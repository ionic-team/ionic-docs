During the linking process, select **GitHub** (recommended) or **Ionic Appflow** as a git host. See our [documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow/basics/git) for more information.\n\nUltimately, this command sets the **id** property in **./ionic.config.json**, which marks this app as linked.\n\nIf you are having issues linking, please get in touch with our [Support](https://ion.link/support-request).",
