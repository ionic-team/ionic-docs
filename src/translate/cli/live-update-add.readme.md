This command adds the Appflow Live Update plugin (`cordova-plugin-ionic`) for both Capacitor and Cordova projects.

For Capacitor projects it runs all the steps necessary to install the plugin, sync with the native projects and add the configuration to the proper iOS and Android configuration files.

For Cordova projects it just takes care of running the proper Cordova CLI command with the submitted parameters.
