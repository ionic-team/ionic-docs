This command is used by `ionic link` when Ionic Appflow is used as the git host.

`ionic git remote` will check the local repository for whether or not the git remote is properly set up. This command operates on the **ionic** remote. For advanced configuration, see **Settings** => **Git** in the app settings of the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com).
