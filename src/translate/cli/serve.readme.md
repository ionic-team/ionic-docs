Easily spin up a development server which launches in your browser. It watches for changes in your source files and automatically reloads with the updated build.

By default, `ionic serve` boots up a development server on `localhost`. To serve to your LAN, specify the `--external` option, which will use all network interfaces and print the external address(es) on which your app is being served.

`ionic serve` uses the Angular CLI. Use `ng serve --help` to list all Angular CLI options for serving your app. See the `ng serve` [docs](https://angular.io/cli/serve) for explanations. Options not listed below are considered advanced and can be passed to the Angular CLI using the `--` separator after the Ionic CLI arguments. See the examples.

The dev server can use HTTPS via the `--ssl` option **(experimental)**. There are several known issues with HTTPS. See issue [#3305](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/issues/3305).
