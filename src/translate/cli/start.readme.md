This command creates a working Ionic app. It installs dependencies for you and sets up your project.

Running `ionic start` without any arguments will prompt you for information about your new project.

The first argument is your app's `name`. Don't worry--you can always change this later. The `--project-id` is generated from `name` unless explicitly specified.

The second argument is the `template` from which to generate your app. You can list all templates with the `--list` option. You can also specify a git repository URL for `template`, in which case the existing project will be cloned.

Use the `--type` option to start projects using older versions of Ionic. For example, you can start an Ionic 3 project with `--type=ionic-angular`. Use `--list` to see all project types and templates.
