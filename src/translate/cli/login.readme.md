Authenticate with Ionic and retrieve a user token, which is stored in the CLI config. Running `ionic login` will open a browser where you can submit your credentials.

If the `IONIC_TOKEN` environment variable is set, the CLI will automatically authenticate you. Use the Dashboard to generate a Personal Access Token.

If you need to create an Ionic account, use `ionic signup` or the Ionic [Website](https://ionicframework.com/signup).

If you are having issues logging in, please get in touch with our [Support](https://ion.link/support-request).
