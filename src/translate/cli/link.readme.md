Link apps on Appflow to local Ionic projects with this command.

If the `id` argument is excluded, this command will prompt you to select an app from Appflow.

Appflow uses a git-based workflow to manage app updates. During the linking process, select **GitHub** (recommended) or **Appflow** as a git host. See our [documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow/basics/git) for more information.

Ultimately, this command sets the **id** property in **./ionic.config.json**, which marks this app as linked.

If you are having issues linking, please get in touch with our [Support](https://ion.link/support-request).
