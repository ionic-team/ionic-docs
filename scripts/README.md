# Continuous Integration Scripts

The purpose of these scripts are to copy the markdown files generated during development of the Ionic Framework to the ionic-team/ionic-docs repo

## Running The Script


Standard run: `npm run ci`
Dry run (don't push): `npm run ci-dry`
Clone only, don't copy docs or push: `npm run ci-prep`
