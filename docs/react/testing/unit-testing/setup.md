# Unit Testing Setup

Ionic requires a few additional steps to set up unit tests. If you are using an Ionic starter project, these steps have already been completed for you.

### Install React Testing Library

React Testing Library is a set of utilities that make it easier to test React components. It's used to interact with components and test their behavior.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

### Initialize Ionic React

Ionic React requires the `setupIonicReact` function to be called before any tests are run. Failing to do so will result in mode-based classes and platform behaviors not being applied to your components.

In `src/setupTest.ts`, add the following code:

```diff
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';

+ import { setupIonicReact } from '@ionic/react';

+ setupIonicReact();

// Mock matchmedia
window.matchMedia = window.matchMedia || function () {
  return {
    matches: false,
    addListener: function () { },
    removeListener: function () { }
  };
};
```
