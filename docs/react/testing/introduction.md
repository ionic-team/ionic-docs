# Testing Ionic React

This document provides an overview of how to test an application built with `@ionic/react`. It covers the basics of testing with React, as well as the specific tools and libraries developers can use to test their applications.

## Introduction

Testing is an important part of the development process, and it helps to ensure that an application is working as intended. In `@ionic/react`, testing is done using a combination of tools and libraries, including Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright or Cypress.

## Types of Tests

There are two types of tests that can be written:

**Unit Tests**: Unit tests are used to test individual functions and components in isolation. They can be written using tools such as [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com).

**Integration Tests**: Integration tests are used to test how different components work together. They can be written using tools such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev).
