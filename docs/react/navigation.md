This guide covers how routing works in an app built with Ionic and React.

`IonReactRouter` uses the popular [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) library under the hood. With Ionic and React Router, you can create multi-page apps with rich page transitions.

Everything you know about routing using React Router carries over into Ionic React. Let's take a look at the basics of an Ionic React app and how routing works with it.

## Routing in Ionic React

Here is a sample `App` component that defines a single route to the "/dashboard" URL. When you visit "/dashboard", the route renders the `DashboardPage` component.

**App.tsx**

```tsx
const App: React.FC = () => (
  <IonApp>
    <IonReactRouter>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route path="/dashboard" component={DashboardPage} />
        <Redirect exact from="/" to="/dashboard" />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonReactRouter>
  </IonApp>
);
```

Directly after the `Route`, we define our default `Redirect`, which, when a user visits the root URL of the app ("/"), it redirects them to the "/dashboard" URL.

The redirect also has the `exact` prop set, which means the URL has to match the `from` prop (or the `path` prop if `exact` was used on a `Route`) precisely for this route to be a match. Without it, this redirect would render for every route, since every route begins with "/".

You can also programmatically redirect from a Route's render method based on a condition, like checking if a user is authed or not:

```tsx
<Route
  exact
  path="/dashboard"
  render={(props) => {
    return isAuthed ? <DashboardPage {...props} /> : <LoginPage />;
  }}
/>
```

## IonReactRouter

The `IonReactRouter` component wraps the traditional [`BrowserRouter`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter) component from React Router, and sets the app up for routing. Therefore, use `IonReactRouter` in place of `BrowserRouter`. You can pass in any props to `IonReactRouter` and they will be passed down to the underlying `BrowserRouter`.

## Nested Routes

Inside the Dashboard page, we define more routes related to this specific section of the app:

**DashboardPage.tsx**

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route exact path="/dashboard" component={UsersListPage} />
        <Route path="/dashboard/users/:id" component={UserDetailPage} />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Here, there are a couple more routes defined to point to pages from within the dashboard portion of the app. Note, that we need to define the whole route in the path, and we can't leave off "/dashboard" even though we arrived to this page from that URL. React Router requires full paths, and relative paths are not supported.

However, we can use the [`match`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match) objects `url` property to provide the URL that was matched to render a component, which helps when working with nested routes:

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
        <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Here, `match.url` contains the value of "/dashboard", since that was the URL used to render the `DashboardPage`.

These routes are grouped in an `IonRouterOutlet`, let's discuss that next.

## IonRouterOutlet

The `IonRouterOutlet` component provides a container for Routes that render Ionic "pages". When a page is in an `IonRouterOutlet`, the container controls the transition animation between the pages as well as controls when a page is created and destroyed, which helps maintain the state between the views when switching back and forth between them.

The `DashboardPage` above shows a users list page and a details page. When navigating between the two pages, the `IonRouterOutlet` provides the appropriate platform page transition and keeps the state of the previous page intact so that when a user navigates back to the list page, it appears in the same state as when it left.

An `IonRouterOutlet` should only contain `Route`s or `Redirect`s. Any other component should be rendered either as a result of a `Route` or outside of the `IonRouterOutlet`.

## Fallback Route

A common routing use case is to provide a "fallback" route to be rendered in the event the location navigated to does not match any of the routes defined.

We can define a fallback route by placing a `Route` component without a `path` property as the last route defined within an `IonRouterOutlet`.

**DashboardPage.tsx**

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
      <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      <Route render={() => <Redirect to={match.url} />} />
    </IonRouterOutlet>
  );
};
```

Here, we see that in the event a location does not match the first two `Route`s the `IonRouterOutlet` will redirect the Ionic React app to the `match.url` path.

You can alternatively supply a component to render instead of providing a redirect.

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
      <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      <Route component={NotFoundPage} />
    </IonRouterOutlet>
  );
};
```

## IonPage

The `IonPage` component wraps each view in an Ionic React app and allows page transitions and stack navigation to work properly. Each view that is navigated to using the router must include an `IonPage` component.

```tsx
import { IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';
import React from 'react';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Home</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent className="ion-padding">Hello World</IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

## Navigation

There are several options available when routing to different views in an Ionic React app. Here, the `UsersListPage` uses `IonItem`'s `routerLink` prop to specify the route to go to when the item is tapped/clicked:

**UsersListPage.tsx**

```tsx
const UsersListPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Users</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent>
        <IonList>
          <IonItem routerLink="/dashboard/users/1">
            <IonLabel>User 1</IonLabel>
          </IonItem>
          <IonItem routerLink="/dashboard/users/2">
            <IonLabel>User 2</IonLabel>
          </IonItem>
        </IonList>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Other components that have the `routerLink` prop are `IonButton`, `IonCard`, `IonRouterLink`, `IonFabButton`, and `IonItemOption`.

Each of these components also have a `routerDirection` prop to explicitly set the type of page transition to use ("back", "forward", or "none").

Outside of these components that have the `routerLink` prop, you can also use React Routers [`Link`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link) component to navigate between views:

```html
<Link to="/dashboard/users/1">User 1</Link>
```

We recommend using one of the above methods whenever possible for routing. The advantage to these approaches is that they both render an anchor (`<a>`)tag, which is suitable for overall app accessibility.

A programmatic option for navigation is using the [`history`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/history) prop that React Router provides to the components it renders via routes.

```tsx
<IonButton
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    history.push('/dashboard/users/1');
  }}
>
  Go to User 1
</IonButton>
```

:::note
`history` is a prop.
:::

## URL Parameters

The second route defined in the Dashboard Page has a URL parameter defined (the ":id" portion in the path). URL parameters are dynamic portions of the `path`, and when the user navigates to a URL such as "/dashboard/users/1", the "1" is saved to a parameter named "id", which can be accessed in the component the route renders. Let's see how that's done.

**UserDetailPage.tsx**

```tsx
interface UserDetailPageProps
  extends RouteComponentProps<{
    id: string;
  }> {}

const UserDetailPage: React.FC<UserDetailPageProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>User Detail</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent>User {match.params.id}</IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

The [`match`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match) prop contains information about the matched route, including the URL params. We obtain the `id` param here and display it on the screen.

Note how we use a TypeScript interface to strongly type the props object. The interface gives us type safety and code completion inside of the component.

## Working with Tabs

When working with tabs, Ionic needs a way to know which view belongs to which tab. The `IonTabs` component comes in handy here, but let's look at what the routing setup for this looks like:

```tsx
<IonApp>
  <IonReactRouter>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route path="/tabs" render={() => <Tabs />} />
        <Route exact path="/">
          <Redirect to="/tabs" />
        </Route>
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonSplitPane>
  </IonReactRouter>
</IonApp>
```

Here, our `tabs` path loads a `Tabs` component. We provide each tab as a route object inside of this component. In this example, we call the path `tabs`, but this can be customized.

Let's start by taking a look at our `Tabs` component:

```tsx
import { Redirect, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import {
  IonContent,
  IonIcon,
  IonLabel,
  IonPage,
  IonRouterOutlet,
  IonTabBar,
  IonTabButton,
  IonTabs
} from '@ionic/react';
import { IonReactRouter } from '@ionic/react-router';
import { ellipse, square, triangle } from 'ionicons/icons';
import Tab1 from './pages/Tab1';
import Tab2 from './pages/Tab2';
import Tab3 from './pages/Tab3';

const Tabs: React.FC = () => (
  <IonPage>
    <IonContent>
      <IonTabs>
        <IonRouterOutlet>
          <Redirect exact path="/tabs" to="/tabs/tab1" />
          <Route exact path="/tabs/tab1">
            <Tab1 />
          </Route>
          <Route exact path="/tabs/tab2">
            <Tab2 />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/tabs/tab3">
            <Tab3 />
          </Route>
          <Route exact path="/tabs">
            <Redirect to="/tabs/tab1" />
          </Route>
        </IonRouterOutlet>
        <IonTabBar slot="bottom">
          <IonTabButton tab="tab1" href="/tabs/tab1">
            <IonIcon icon={triangle} />
            <IonLabel>Tab 1</IonLabel>
          </IonTabButton>
          <IonTabButton tab="tab2" href="/tabs/tab2">
            <IonIcon icon={ellipse} />
            <IonLabel>Tab 2</IonLabel>
          </IonTabButton>
          <IonTabButton tab="tab3" href="/tabs/tab3">
            <IonIcon icon={square} />
            <IonLabel>Tab 3</IonLabel>
          </IonTabButton>
        </IonTabBar>
      </IonTabs>
    </IonContent>
  </IonPage>
);

export default Tabs;
```

If you have worked with Ionic Framework before, this should feel familiar. We create an `IonTabs` component and provide an `IonTabBar`. The `IonTabBar` provides `IonTabButton` components, each with a `tab` property that is associated with its corresponding tab in the router config. We also provide an `IonRouterOutlet` to give `IonTabs` an outlet to render the different tab views in.

### How Tabs in Ionic Work

Each tab in Ionic is treated as an individual navigation stack. This means if you have three tabs in your application, each tab has its own navigation stack. Within each stack you can navigate forwards (push a view) and backwards (pop a view).

This behavior is important to note as it is different than most tab implementations that are found in other web based UI libraries. Other libraries typically manage tabs as one single history stack.
 
Since Ionic is focused on helping developers build mobile apps, the tabs in Ionic are designed to match native mobile tabs as closely as possible. As a result, there may be certain behaviors in Ionic's tabs that differ from tabs implementations you have seen in other UI libraries. Read on to learn more about some of these differences.

### Child Routes within Tabs

When adding additional routes to tabs you should write them as sibling routes with the parent tab as the path prefix. The example below defines the `/tabs/tab1/view` route as a sibling of the `/tabs/tab1` route. Since this new route has the `tab1` prefix, it will be rendered inside of the `Tabs` component, and Tab 1 will still be selected in the `IonTabBar`.

```tsx
<IonTabs>
  <IonRouterOutlet>
    <Redirect exact path="/tabs" to="/tabs/tab1" />
    <Route exact path="/tabs/tab1">
      <Tab1 />
    </Route>
    <Route exact path="/tabs/tab1/view">
      <Tab1View />
    </Route>
    <Route exact path="/tabs/tab2">
      <Tab2 />
    </Route>
    <Route path="/tabs/tab3">
      <Tab3 />
    </Route>
    <Route exact path="/tabs">
      <Redirect to="/tabs/tab1" />
    </Route>
  </IonRouterOutlet>
  <IonTabBar slot="bottom">
    <IonTabButton tab="tab1" href="/tabs/tab1">
      <IonIcon icon={triangle} />
      <IonLabel>Tab 1</IonLabel>
    </IonTabButton>
    <IonTabButton tab="tab2" href="/tabs/tab2">
      <IonIcon icon={ellipse} />
      <IonLabel>Tab 2</IonLabel>
    </IonTabButton>
    <IonTabButton tab="tab3" href="/tabs/tab3">
      <IonIcon icon={square} />
      <IonLabel>Tab 3</IonLabel>
    </IonTabButton>
  </IonTabBar>
</IonTabs>
```

### Switching Between Tabs

Since each tab is its own navigation stack, it is important to note that these navigation stacks should never interact. This means that there should never be a button in Tab 1 that routes a user to Tab 2. In other words, tabs should only be changed by the user tapping a tab button in the tab bar.

A good example of this in practice is the iOS App Store and Google Play Store mobile applications. These apps both provide tabbed interfaces, but neither one ever routes the user across tabs. For example, the "Games" tab in the iOS App Store app never directs users to the "Search" tab and vice versa.

Let's take a look at a couple common mistakes that are made with tabs.

**A Settings Tab That Multiple Tabs Reference**

A common practice is to create a Settings view as its own tab. This is great if developers need to present several nested settings menus. However, other tabs should never try to route to the Settings tab. As we mentioned above, the only way that the Settings tab should be activated is by a user tapping the appropriate tab button.

If you find that your tabs need to reference the Settings tab, we recommend making the Settings view a modal by using `ion-modal`. This is a practice found in the iOS App Store app. With this approach, any tab can present the modal without breaking the mobile tabs pattern of each tab being its own stack.

The example below shows how the iOS App Store app handles presenting an "Account" view from multiple tabs. By presenting the "Account" view in a modal, the app can work within the mobile tabs best practices to show the same view across multiple tabs.

<video
  style={{
    'margin': '40px auto',
    'display': 'flex'
  }}
  width="400"
  src={useBaseUrl('video/tabs-account-demo.mp4')} 
  controls
></video>

**Reusing Views Across Tabs**

Another common practice is to present the same view in multiple tabs. Developers often try to do this by having the view contained in a single tab, with other tabs routing to that tab. As we mentioned above, this breaks the mobile tabs pattern and should be avoided.

Instead, we recommend having routes in each tab that reference the same component. This is a practice done in popular apps like Spotify. For example, you can access an album or podcast from the "Home", "Search", and "Your Library" tabs. When accessing the album or podcast, users stay within that tab. The app does this by creating routes per tab and sharing a common component in the codebase.

The example below shows how the Spotify app reuses the same album component to show content in multiple tabs. Notice that each screenshot shows the same album but from a different tab.

| Home Tab | Search Tab |
| :------: | :--------: |
| <img src={useBaseUrl('img/usage/tabs-home.jpg')} /> | <img src={useBaseUrl('img/usage/tabs-search.jpg')} /> |

## Live Example

If you would prefer to get hands on with the concepts and code described above, please checkout our [live example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ionic-react-routing?file=src/index.tsx) of the topics above on StackBlitz.

### IonRouterOutlet in a Tabs View

When working in a tabs view, Ionic React needs a way to determine what views belong to which tabs. We accomplish this by taking advantage of the fact that the paths provided to a `Route` are regular expressions.

While the syntax looks a bit strange, it is reasonably straightforward once you understand it.

For example, the routes for a view with two tabs (sessions and speakers) can be set up as such:

```tsx
<IonRouterOutlet>
  <Route path="/:tab(sessions)" component={SessionsPage} exact={true} />
  <Route path="/:tab(sessions)/:id" component={SessionDetail} />
  <Route path="/:tab(speakers)" component={SpeakerList} exact={true} />
</IonRouterOutlet>
```

If the navigated URL were "/sessions", it would match the first route and add a URL parameter named "tab" with the value of "sessions" to the resulting `match` object passed into `SessionsPage`.

When a user navigates to a session detail page ("/sessions/1" for instance), the second route adds a URL parameter named "tab" with a value of "sessions". When `IonRouterOutlet` sees that both pages are in the same "sessions" tab, it provides an animated page transition to the new view. If a user navigates to a new tab ("speakers" in this case), `IonRouterOutlet` knows not to provide the animation.

### Switches in IonRouterOutlet

Since `IonRouterOutlet` takes over the job in determining which routes get rendered, using a `Switch` from React Router has no effect when used inside of an `IonRouterOutlet`. Switches still function as expected when used outside an `IonRouterOutlet`.
