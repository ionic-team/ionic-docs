Because Ionic Apps are built with web technologies, they can run just as well as a Progressive Web App as they can a native app. Not sure what PWAs are? Check out Ionic's <a href="https://ionicframework.com/pwa" target="_blank">PWA Overview</a> or the [What are Progressive Web Apps](../core-concepts/what-are-progressive-web-apps.md) page for more info.

For the frameworks Ionic supports, we've created dedicated guides that go into more detail. Below are links for Angular and React.
