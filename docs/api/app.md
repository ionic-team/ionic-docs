App is a container element for an Ionic application. There should only be one `<ion-app>` element per project. An app can have many Ionic components including menus, headers, content, and footers. The overlay components get appended to the `<ion-app>` when they are presented.

Using `ion-app` enables the following behaviors:

* [Keyboard Lifecycle Events](../developing/keyboard#keyboard-lifecycle-events) without the need for any native plugins
* [Hardware Back Button Listeners](../developing/hardware-back-button) for customizing the hardware back button behavior on Android devices
* Status bar support in Capacitor or Cordova which allows users to scroll to the top of the view by tapping the status bar
* Scroll assist utilities which scroll the content so focused text inputs are not covered by the on-screen keyboard
* [Ripple effect](./ripple-effect) when activating buttons on Material Design mode
* Other tap and focus utilities which make the experience of using an Ionic app feel more native
