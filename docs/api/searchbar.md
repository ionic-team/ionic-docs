Searchbars represent a text field that can be used to search through a collection. They can be displayed inside of a toolbar or the main content. A searchbar should be used instead of an input to search lists.


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/searchbar/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Search Icon

A search icon is displayed to the left of the input field in a searchbar. It can be customized to any [Ionicon](https://ionic.io/ionicons/).

import SearchIcon from '@site/static/usage/searchbar/search-icon/index.md';

<SearchIcon />


## Clear Button

A clear button is displayed when a searchbar has a value or upon entering input in the searchbar's text field. Clicking on the clear button will erase the text field and the input will remain focused. By default, the clear button is set to show when focusing the searchbar, but it can be set to always show or never show. The icon inside of the clear button can also be customized to any [Ionicon](https://ionic.io/ionicons/).

import ClearButton from '@site/static/usage/searchbar/clear-button/index.md';

<ClearButton />


## Cancel Button

A cancel button can be enabled which will clear the input and lose the focus upon click. By default, cancel buttons are set to never show, but they can be set to always show or only show when focusing the searchbar. The cancel button is displayed as text in `ios` mode, and as an icon in `md` mode. Both the text and icon can be customized using different properties, with the icon accepting any [Ionicon](https://ionic.io/ionicons/).

import CancelButton from '@site/static/usage/searchbar/cancel-button/index.md';

<CancelButton />


## Searchbars in Toolbars

Searchbars are styled to look native when placed inside of a toolbar. In iOS, searchbars should be placed in their own toolbar, under a toolbar that contains the page title. In Material Design, searchbars are either persistently displayed in their own toolbar, or expand over a toolbar containing the page title.

<!-- Reuse the playground from the Toolbar directory -->
import Toolbar from '@site/static/usage/toolbar/searchbars/index.md';

<Toolbar />


## Debounce

A debounce can be set on the searchbar in order to delay triggering the `ionChange` event. This is useful when querying data, as it can be used to wait to make a request instead of requesting the data each time a character is entered in the input.

import Debounce from '@site/static/usage/searchbar/debounce/index.md';

<Debounce />


## Theming

### CSS Custom Properties

Searchbar uses scoped encapsulation, which means it will automatically scope its CSS by appending each of the styles with an additional class at runtime. Overriding scoped selectors in CSS requires a [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) selector. Targeting the `ion-searchbar` for customization will not work, therefore we recommend adding a class and customizing it that way.

## Keyboard Display

### Android

By default, tapping the input will cause the keyboard to appear with a magnifying glass icon on the submit button. You can optionally set the `inputmode` property to `"search"`, which will change the icon from a magnifying glass to a carriage return.

### iOS

By default, tapping the input will cause the keyboard to appear with the text "return" on a gray submit button. You can optionally set the `inputmode` property to `"search"`, which will change the text from "return" to "go", and change the button color from gray to blue. Alternatively, you can wrap the `ion-searchbar` in a `form` element with an `action` property. This will cause the keyboard to appear with a blue submit button that says "search".

## Interfaces

### SearchbarChangeEventDetail

```typescript
interface SearchbarChangeEventDetail {
  value?: string;
}
```

### SearchbarCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface SearchbarCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: SearchbarChangeEventDetail;
  target: HTMLIonSearchbarElement;
}
```
