Radios should be used inside of a [radio group](./radio-group). Pressing a radio will check it and uncheck the previously selected radio, if there is one. They can also be checked programmatically by setting the value property of the parent radio group to the value of the radio.

When radios are inside of a radio group, only one radio will be checked at any time. If more than one item should be selected, [checkboxes](./checkbox) should be used instead. Radios can be disabled within a group to prevent interaction with them.

## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/basic/index.md';

<Basic />

## Label Placement

Developers can use the `labelPlacement` property to control how the label is placed relative to the control.  This property mirrors the flexbox `flex-direction` property.

import LabelPlacement from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/label-placement/index.md';

<LabelPlacement />

## Object Value References

By default, the radio group uses strict equality (`===`) to determine if an option is selected. This can be overridden by providing a property name or a function to the `compareWith` property.

import UsingComparewith from '@site/static/usage/v7/radio/using-comparewith/index.md';

<UsingComparewith />

## Alignment

Developers can use the `alignment` property to control how the label and control are aligned on the cross axis. This property mirrors the flexbox `align-items` property.

:::note
Stacked radios can be aligned using the `alignment` property. This can be useful when the label and control need to be centered horizontally.
:::

import Alignment from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/alignment/index.md';

<Alignment />

## Justification

Developers can use the `justify` property to control how the label and control are packed on a line. This property mirrors the flexbox `justify-content` property.

import Justify from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/justify/index.md';

<Justify />

:::note
`ion-item` is only used in the demos to emphasize how `justify` works. It is not needed in order for `justify` to function correctly.
:::

## Deselecting Radios

By default, once a radio is selected it cannot be deselected; pressing it again will keep it selected. This behavior can be modified by using the `allowEmptySelection` property on the parent radio group, which enables the radios to be deselected.

import EmptySelection from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/empty-selection/index.md';

<EmptySelection />

## Migrating from Legacy Radio Syntax

A simpler radio syntax was introduced in Ionic 7.0. This new syntax reduces the boilerplate required to setup an radio, resolves accessibility issues, and improves the developer experience.

Developers can perform this migration one radio at a time. While developers can continue using the legacy syntax, we recommend migrating as soon as possible.

### Using the Modern Syntax

Using the modern syntax involves removing the `ion-label` and passing the label directly inside of `ion-radio`. The placement of the label can be configured using the `labelPlacement` property on `ion-radio`. The way the label and the control are packed on a line can be controlled using the `justify` property on `ion-radio`.

import Migration from '@site/static/usage/v8/radio/migration/index.md';

<Migration />
  

:::note
In past versions of Ionic, `ion-item` was required for `ion-radio` to function properly. Starting in Ionic 7.0, `ion-radio` should only be used in an `ion-item` when the item is placed in an `ion-list`. Additionally, `ion-item` is no longer required for `ion-radio` to function properly.
:::

### Using the Legacy Syntax

Ionic uses heuristics to detect if an app is using the modern radio syntax. In some instances, it may be preferable to continue using the legacy syntax. Developers can set the `legacy` property on `ion-radio` to `true` to force that instance of the radio to use the legacy syntax.
