Toolbars are generally positioned above or below content and provide content and actions for the current screen. When placed within the [content](./content), toolbars will scroll with the content.

Toolbars can contain several different components including titles, buttons, icons, back buttons, menu buttons, searchbars, segments, progress bars, and more.


## Basic Usage

It is recommended to put a toolbar inside of a [header](./header) or [footer](./footer) for proper positioning. When a toolbar is placed in a header it will appear fixed at the top of the content. When it is placed in a footer it will appear fixed at the bottom. Fullscreen content will scroll behind a toolbar in a header or footer. A [title](./title) component can be used to display text inside of the toolbar.

## Buttons in Toolbars

Buttons placed in a toolbar should be placed inside of the [buttons](./buttons) component. The buttons component can be positioned inside of the toolbar using a named [slot](#slots). The `"primary"` and `"secondary"` slots behave differently in `ios` and `md` mode.

The buttons component can wrap a standard [button](./button), [back button](./back-button), [menu button](./menu-button), or several of any of them. A button in a toolbar is styled to be clear by default, but this can be changed using the [`fill`](./button#fill) property on the button. The properties included on back button and menu button in this example are for display purposes; see their respective documentation for proper usage.

## Searchbars in Toolbars

A [searchbar](./searchbar) can be placed inside of a toolbar to search through the content. It should be the only child component of the toolbar, and will take up the full width and height.

import Searchbars from '@site/static/usage/toolbar/searchbars/index.md';

<Searchbars />


## Segments in Toolbars

[Segments](./segment) are generally used in toolbars to toggle between two different content views on the same page. They can be placed in a toolbar with other components, such as buttons, but should not be placed alongside a title.

import Segments from '@site/static/usage/toolbar/segments/index.md';

<Segments />


## Progress Bars in Toolbars

A [progress bar](./progress-bar) is used as a loading indicator to show an ongoing process in an app. Progress bars can be placed with any other components inside of a toolbar as they will align with the bottom of the toolbar.
