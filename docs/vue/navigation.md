This guide covers how routing works in an app built with Ionic and Vue.

The `IonRouterOutlet` component uses the popular [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) library under the hood. With Ionic and Vue Router, you can create multi-page apps with rich page transitions.

Everything you know about routing using Vue Router carries over into Ionic Vue. Let's take a look at the basics of an Ionic Vue app and how routing works with it.

## A Brief Note

While reading this guide, you may notice that most of these concepts are very similar to the concepts found in Vue Router without Ionic Framework. Your observation would be correct! Ionic Vue leverages the best parts of Vue Router to make the transition to building apps with Ionic Framework as seamless as possible. As a result, we recommend relying on Vue Router features as much as possible rather than trying to build your own routing solutions.

## A Simple Route

Here is a sample routing configuration that defines a single route to the "/home" URL. When you visit "/home", the route renders the `HomePage` component.

**router/index.ts**

```tsx
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from '@ionic/vue-router';
import { RouteRecordRaw } from 'vue-router';
import HomePage from '@/views/Home.vue';

const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'Home',
    component: HomePage,
  },
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(process.env.BASE_URL),
  routes,
});

export default router;
```

On the app's initial load, the app will render the `HomePage` component as that is what is configured here.

## Handling Redirects

What if we wanted to land a different path on our initial load? For this, we can use router redirects. Redirects work the same way that a typical route object does, but just includes some different keys:

```tsx
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/home',
  },
  {
    path: '/home',
    name: 'Home',
    component: HomePage,
  },
];
```

In our redirect, we look for the index path of our app. Then if we load that, we redirect to the `home` route.

## Navigating to Different Routes

This is all great, but how does one actually navigate to a route? For this, we can use the `router-link` property. Let's create a new routing setup:

```tsx
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/home',
  },
  {
    path: '/home',
    name: 'Home',
    component: HomePage,
  },
  {
    path: '/detail',
    name: 'Detail',
    component: DetailPage,
  },
];
```

Say we start on the `home` route, and we want to add a button that takes us to the `detail` route. We can do this using the following HTML to navigate to the `detail` route:

```html
<ion-button router-link="/detail">Go to detail</ion-button>
```

We can also programmatically navigate in our app by using the router API:

```html
<template>
  <ion-page>
    <ion-content>
      <ion-button @click="() => router.push('/detail')">Go to detail</ion-button>
    </ion-content>
  </ion-page>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import { IonButton, IonContent, IonPage } from '@ionic/vue';
  import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
  import { useRouter } from 'vue-router';

  export default defineComponent({
    name: 'HomePage',
    components: {
      IonButton,
      IonContent,
      IonPage,
    },
    setup() {
      const router = useRouter();
      return { router };
    },
  });
</script>
```

Both options provide the same navigation mechanism, just fitting different use cases.

### Navigating using `router-link`

The `router-link` attribute can be set on any Ionic Vue component, and the router will navigate to the route specified when the component is clicked. The `router-link` attribute accepts string values as well as named routes, just like `router.push` from Vue Router. For additional control, the `router-direction` and `router-animation` attributes can be set as well.

The `router-direction` attribute accepts values of `forward`, `back`, or `none` and is used to control the direction of the page transition.

The `router-animation` attribute accepts an `AnimationBuilder` function and is used to provide a custom page transition that is only used when clicking the component it is provided on. The `AnimationBuilder` type is a function that returns an Ionic Animation instance. See the [Animations documentation](../utilities/animations) for more information on using animations in Ionic Vue.

```html
<ion-button router-link="/page2" router-direction="back" :router-animation="myAnimation">Click Me</ion-button>
```

### Navigating using `useIonRouter`

One downside of using `router-link` is that you cannot run custom code prior to navigating. This makes tasks such as firing off a network request prior to navigation difficult. You could use Vue Router directly, but then you lose the ability to control the page transition. This is where the `useIonRouter` utility is helpful.

The `useIonRouter` utility is a function that provides methods for programmatic navigation while having full control over the page transitions. This makes it easy to run custom code before navigating.

This first example lets us push a new page onto the stack with a custom page transition:

```js
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
import { useIonRouter } from '@ionic/vue';
import { customAnimation } from '@/animations/customAnimation';

export default defineComponent({
  ...,
  setup() {
    const ionRouter = useIonRouter();

    ionRouter.push('/page2', customAnimation);
  }
});
```

`useIonRouter` provides convenience `push`, `replace`, `back`, and `forward` methods to make it easy to use common navigation actions. It also provides a `navigate` method which can be used in more complex navigation scenarios:

```js
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
import { useIonRouter } from '@ionic/vue';
import { customAnimation } from '@/animations/customAnimation';

export default defineComponent({
  ...,
  setup() {
    const ionRouter = useIonRouter();

    ionRouter.navigate('/page2', 'forward', 'replace', customAnimation);
  }
});
```

The example above has the app navigate to `/page2` with a custom animation that uses the forward direction. In addition, the `replace` value ensures that the app replaces the current history entry when navigating.

:::note
`useIonRouter` uses the Vue `inject()` function and should only be used inside of your `setup()` function.
:::

See the [useIonRouter documentation](./utility-functions#router) for more details as well as type information.

### Navigating using `router.go`

Vue Router has a [router.go](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#go) method that allows developers to move forward or backward through the application history. Let's take a look at an example.

Say you have the following application history:

`/pageA` --> `/pageB` --> `/pageC`

If you were to call `router.go(-2)` on `/pageC`, you would be brought back to `/pageA`. If you then called `router.go(2)`, you would be brought to `/pageC`.

A key characteristic of `router.go()` is that it expects your application history to be linear. This means that `router.go()` should not be used in applications that make use of non-linear routing. See [Linear Routing versus Non-Linear Routing](#linear-routing-versus-non-linear-routing) for more information.

## Lazy Loading Routes

The current way our routes are setup makes it so they are included in the same initial chunk when loading the app, which is not always ideal. Instead, we can set up our routes so that components are loaded as they are needed:

```tsx
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/home',
  },
  {
    path: '/home',
    name: 'Home',
    component: HomePage,
  },
  {
    path: '/detail',
    name: 'Detail',
    component: () => import('@/views/DetailPage.vue'),
  },
];
```

Here, we have the same setup as before only this time `DetailPage` has been replaced with an import call. This will result in the `DetailPage` component no longer being part of the chunk that is requested on application load.

## Linear Routing versus Non-Linear Routing

### Linear Routing

If you have built a web app that uses routing, you likely have used linear routing before. Linear routing means that you can move forward or backward through the application history by pushing and popping pages.

The following is an example of linear routing in a mobile app:

<video
  style={{
    margin: '40px auto',
    display: 'flex',
  }}
  width="400"
  src={useBaseUrl('video/linear-routing-demo.mp4')}
  controls
></video>

The application history in this example has the following path:

`Accessibility` --> `VoiceOver` --> `Speech`

When we press the back button, we follow that same routing path except in reverse. Linear routing is helpful in that it allows for simple and predictable routing behaviors. It also means we can use Vue Router APIs such as [router.go()](#navigating-using-routergo).

The downside of linear routing is that it does not allow for complex user experiences such as tab views. This is where non-linear routing comes into play.

### Non-Linear Routing

Non-linear routing is a concept that may be new to many web developers learning to build mobile apps with Ionic.

Non-linear routing means that the view that the user should go back to is not necessarily the previous view that was displayed on the screen.

The following is an example of non-linear routing:

<video
  style={{
    margin: '40px auto',
    display: 'flex',
  }}
  width="400"
  src={useBaseUrl('video/non-linear-routing-demo.mp4')}
  controls
></video>

In the example above, we start on the `Originals` tab. Tapping a card brings us to the `Ted Lasso` view within the `Originals` tab.

From here, we switch to the `Search` tab. Then, we tap the `Originals` tab again and are brought back to the `Ted Lasso` view. At this point, we have started using non-linear routing.

Why is this non-linear routing? The previous view we were on was the `Search` view. However, pressing the back button on the `Ted Lasso` view should bring us back to the root `Originals` view. This happens because each tab in a mobile app is treated as its own stack. The [Working with Tabs](#working-with-tabs) sections goes over this in more detail.

If tapping the back button simply called `router.go(-1)` from the `Ted Lasso` view, we would be brought back to the `Search` view which is not correct.

Non-linear routing allows for sophisticated user flows that linear routing cannot handle. However, certain linear routing APIs such as `router.go()` cannot be used in this non-linear environment. This means that `router.go()` should not be used when using tabs or nested outlets.

### Which one should I choose?

We recommend keeping your application as simple as possible until you need to add non-linear routing. Non-linear routing is very powerful, but it also adds a considerable amount of complexity to mobile applications.

The two most common uses of non-linear routing is with tabs and nested `ion-router-outlet`s. We recommend only using non-linear routing if your application meets the tabs or nested router outlet use cases.

For more on tabs, please see [Working with Tabs](#working-with-tabs).

For more on nested router outlets, please see [Nested Routes](#nested-routes).

## Shared URLs versus Nested Routes

A common point of confusion when setting up routing is deciding between shared URLs or nested routes. This part of the guide will explain both and help you decide which one to use.

### Shared URLs

Shared URLs is a route configuration where routes have pieces of the URL in common. The following is an example of a shared URL configuration:

```tsx
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    component: DashboardMainPage,
  },
  {
    path: '/dashboard/stats',
    component: DashboardStatsPage,
  },
];
```

The above routes are considered "shared" because they reuse the `dashboard` piece of the URL.

### Nested Routes

Nested Routes is a route configuration where routes are listed as children of other routes. The following is an example of a nested route configuration:

```tsx
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/dashboard/:id',
    component: DashboardRouterOutlet,
    children: [
      {
        path: '',
        component: DashboardMainPage,
      },
      {
        path: 'stats',
        component: DashboardStatsPage,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

The above routes are nested because they are in the `children` array of the parent route. Notice that the parent route renders the `DashboardRouterOutlet` component. When you nest routes, you need to render another instance of `ion-router-outlet`.

### Which one should I choose?

Shared URLs are great when you want to transition from page A to page B while preserving the relationship between the two pages in the URL. In our previous example, a button on the `/dashboard` page could transition to the `/dashboard/stats` page. The relationship between the two pages is preserved because of a) the page transition and b) the url.

Nested routes should be used when you want to render content in outlet A while also rendering sub-content inside of a nested outlet B. The most common use case you will run into is tabs. When you load up a tabs Ionic starter application, you will see `ion-tab-bar` and `ion-tabs` components rendered in the first `ion-router-outlet`. The `ion-tabs` component renders another `ion-router-outlet` which is responsible for rendering the contents of each tab.

There are very few use cases in which nested routes make sense in mobile applications. When in doubt, use the shared URL route configuration. We strongly caution against using nested routing in contexts other than tabs as it can quickly make navigating your app confusing.

## Working with Tabs

When working with tabs, Ionic Vue needs a way to know which view belongs to which tab. The `IonTabs` component comes in handy here, but let's look at what the routing setup for this looks like:

```tsx
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/tabs/tab1',
  },
  {
    path: '/tabs/',
    component: Tabs,
    children: [
      {
        path: '',
        redirect: 'tab1',
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'tab2',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab2.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'tab3',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab3.vue'),
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

Here, our `tabs` path loads a `Tabs` component. We provide each tab as a route object inside of the `children` array. In this example, we call the path `tabs`, but this can be customized.

Let's start by taking a look at our `Tabs` component:

```html
<template>
  <ion-page>
    <ion-tabs>
      <ion-router-outlet></ion-router-outlet>
      <ion-tab-bar slot="bottom">
        <ion-tab-button tab="tab1" href="/tabs/tab1">
          <ion-icon :icon="triangle" />
          <ion-label>Tab 1</ion-label>
        </ion-tab-button>

        <ion-tab-button tab="tab2" href="/tabs/tab2">
          <ion-icon :icon="ellipse" />
          <ion-label>Tab 2</ion-label>
        </ion-tab-button>

        <ion-tab-button tab="tab3" href="/tabs/tab3">
          <ion-icon :icon="square" />
          <ion-label>Tab 3</ion-label>
        </ion-tab-button>
      </ion-tab-bar>
    </ion-tabs>
  </ion-page>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import { IonTabBar, IonTabButton, IonTabs, IonLabel, IonIcon, IonPage, IonRouterOutlet } from '@ionic/vue';
  import { ellipse, square, triangle } from 'ionicons/icons';

  export default {
    name: 'Tabs',
    components: {
      IonLabel,
      IonTabs,
      IonTabBar,
      IonTabButton,
      IonIcon,
      IonPage,
      IonRouterOutlet,
    },
    setup() {
      return {
        ellipse,
        square,
        triangle,
      };
    },
  };
</script>
```

If you have worked with Ionic Framework before, this should feel familiar. We create an `ion-tabs` component and provide an `ion-tab-bar`. The `ion-tab-bar` provides `ion-tab-button` components, each with a `tab` property that is associated with its corresponding tab in the router config. We also provide an `ion-router-outlet` to give `ion-tabs` an outlet to render the different tab views in.

### How Tabs in Ionic Work

Each tab in Ionic is treated as an individual navigation stack. This means if you have three tabs in your application, each tab has its own navigation stack. Within each stack you can navigate forwards (push a view) and backwards (pop a view).

This behavior is important to note as it is different than most tab implementations that are found in other web based UI libraries. Other libraries typically manage tabs as one single history stack.

Since Ionic is focused on helping developers build mobile apps, the tabs in Ionic are designed to match native mobile tabs as closely as possible. As a result, there may be certain behaviors in Ionic's tabs that differ from tabs implementations you have seen in other UI libraries. Read on to learn more about some of these differences.

### Child Routes within Tabs

When adding additional routes to tabs you should write them as sibling routes with the parent tab as the path prefix. The example below defines the `/tabs/tab1/view` route as a sibling of the `/tabs/tab1` route. Since this new route has the `tab1` prefix, it will be rendered inside of the `Tabs` component, and Tab 1 will still be selected in the `ion-tab-bar`.

```tsx
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/tabs/tab1',
  },
  {
    path: '/tabs/',
    component: Tabs,
    children: [
      {
        path: '',
        redirect: 'tab1',
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1/view',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1View.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'tab2',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab2.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'tab3',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab3.vue'),
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### Switching Between Tabs

Since each tab is its own navigation stack, it is important to note that these navigation stacks should never interact. This means that there should never be a button in Tab 1 that routes a user to Tab 2. In other words, tabs should only be changed by the user tapping a tab button in the tab bar.

A good example of this in practice is the iOS App Store and Google Play Store mobile applications. These apps both provide tabbed interfaces, but neither one ever routes the user across tabs. For example, the "Games" tab in the iOS App Store app never directs users to the "Search" tab and vice versa.

Let's take a look at a couple common mistakes that are made with tabs.

**A Settings Tab That Multiple Tabs Reference**

A common practice is to create a Settings view as its own tab. This is great if developers need to present several nested settings menus. However, other tabs should never try to route to the Settings tab. As we mentioned above, the only way that the Settings tab should be activated is by a user tapping the appropriate tab button.

If you find that your tabs need to reference the Settings tab, we recommend making the Settings view a modal by using `ion-modal`. This is a practice found in the iOS App Store app. With this approach, any tab can present the modal without breaking the mobile tabs pattern of each tab being its own stack.

The example below shows how the iOS App Store app handles presenting an "Account" view from multiple tabs. By presenting the "Account" view in a modal, the app can work within the mobile tabs best practices to show the same view across multiple tabs.

<video
  style={{
    margin: '40px auto',
    display: 'flex',
  }}
  width="400"
  src={useBaseUrl('video/tabs-account-demo.mp4')}
  controls
></video>

**Reusing Views Across Tabs**

Another common practice is to present the same view in multiple tabs. Developers often try to do this by having the view contained in a single tab, with other tabs routing to that tab. As we mentioned above, this breaks the mobile tabs pattern and should be avoided.

Instead, we recommend having routes in each tab that reference the same component. This is a practice done in popular apps like Spotify. For example, you can access an album or podcast from the "Home", "Search", and "Your Library" tabs. When accessing the album or podcast, users stay within that tab. The app does this by creating routes per tab and sharing a common component in the codebase.

The example below shows how the Spotify app reuses the same album component to show content in multiple tabs. Notice that each screenshot shows the same album but from a different tab.

|                      Home Tab                       |                      Search Tab                       |
| :-------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src={useBaseUrl('img/usage/tabs-home.jpg')} /> | <img src={useBaseUrl('img/usage/tabs-search.jpg')} /> |

## Components

### IonRouterOutlet

The `IonRouterOutlet` component provides a container to render your views in. It is similar to the `RouterView` component found in other Vue applications except that `IonRouterOutlet` can render multiple pages in the DOM in the same outlet. When a component is rendered in `IonRouterOutlet` we consider this to be an Ionic Framework "page". The router outlet container controls the transition animation between the pages as well as controls when a page is created and destroyed. This helps maintain the state between the views when switching back and forth between them.

Nothing should be provided inside of `IonRouterOutlet` when setting it up in your template. While `IonRouterOutlet` can be nested in child components, we caution against it as it typically makes navigation in apps confusing. See [Shared URLs versus Nested Routes](#shared-urls-versus-nested-routes) for more information.

### IonPage

The `IonPage` component wraps each view in an Ionic Vue app and allows page transitions and stack navigation to work properly. Each view that is navigated to using the router must include an `IonPage` component.

```html
<template>
  <ion-page>
    <ion-header>
      <ion-toolbar>
        <ion-title>Home</ion-title>
      </ion-toolbar>
    </ion-header>
    <ion-content class="ion-padding">Hello World</ion-content>
  </ion-page>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import { IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/vue';
  import { defineComponent } from 'vue';

  export default defineComponent({
    components: {
      IonContent,
      IonHeader,
      IonPage,
      IonTitle,
      IonToolbar,
    },
  });
</script>
```

Components presented via `IonModal` or `IonPopover` do not typically need an `IonPage` component unless you need a wrapper element. In that case, we recommend using `IonPage` so that the component dimensions are still computed properly.

## Functions

### useIonRouter

▸ **useIonRouter**(): [`UseIonRouterResult`](utility-functions#useionrouterresult)

Returns the Ionic router instance, containing API methods for navigating, customizing page transitions and routing context for native features. This function can be used in combination with the [`useRouter`](https://router.vuejs.org/api/index.html#userouter) function from Vue.

For example usages, please refer to our [Utility Functions](utility-functions#useionrouter).

## URL Parameters

Let's expand upon our original routing example to show how we can use URL parameters:

```tsx
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/home',
  },
  {
    path: '/home',
    name: 'Home',
    component: HomePage,
  },
  {
    path: '/detail/:id',
    name: 'Detail',
    component: DetailPage,
  },
];
```

Notice that we have now added `:id` to the end of our `detail` path string. URL parameters are dynamic portions of our route paths. When the user navigates to a URL such as `/details/1` the "1" is saved to a parameter named "id" which can be accessed in the component when the route renders.

Let's look at how to use it in our component:

```html
<template>
  <ion-page>
    <ion-header>
      <ion-toolbar>
        <ion-title>Details</ion-title>
      </ion-toolbar>
    </ion-header>

    <ion-content> Detail ID: {{ id }} </ion-content>
  </ion-page>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import { IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/vue';
  import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
  import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

  export default defineComponent({
    name: 'Detail',
    components: {
      IonContent,
      IonHeader,
      IonPage,
      IonTitle,
      IonToolbar,
    },
    setup() {
      const route = useRoute();
      const { id } = route.params;
      return { id };
    },
  });
</script>
```

Our `route` variable contains an instance of the current route. It also contains any parameters we have passed in. We can obtain the `id` parameter from here and display it on the screen.

## Router History

Vue Router ships with a configurable history mode. Let's look at the different options and why you might want to use each one.

- `createWebHistory`: This option creates an HTML5 history. It leverages the History API to achieve URL navigation without a page reload. This is the most common history mode for single page applications. When in doubt, use `createWebHistory`.

- `createWebHashHistory`: This option adds a hash (`#`) to your URL. This is useful for web applications with no host or when you do not have full control over the server routes. Search engines sometimes ignore hash fragments, so you should use `createWebHistory` instead if SEO is important for your application.

- `createMemoryHistory`: This option creates an in-memory based history. This is mainly used to handle server-side rendering (SSR).
