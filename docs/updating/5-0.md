# Updating from Ionic 4 to Ionic 5

Migrating an app from 4.x to 5.x requires a few updates to the API properties, CSS utilities, and the installed package dependencies.

:::note
This guide assumes that you have already updated your app to the latest version of Ionic 4. Make sure you have followed the [Upgrading to Ionic 4 Guide](./4-0) before starting this guide.

### API and CSS Updates

For a complete list of breaking changes from 4.x to 5.x, please refer to [the breaking changes document](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/master/BREAKING.md#version-5x) in the Ionic core repo.

### Packages and Dependencies

For Angular based projects, you can simply run:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@latest @ionic/angular-toolkit@latest --save
```

For React projects, you can run:

```shell
npm install @ionic/react@latest @ionic/react-router@latest ionicons@latest
```

For Stencil / vanilla JS projects, you can run:

```shell
npm i @ionic/core@latest --save
```

If you would like a fresh project starter, a new project base can be created from the CLI and an existing app can be migrated over manually.
