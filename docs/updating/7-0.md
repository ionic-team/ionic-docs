# Updating from Ionic 6 to Ionic 7

:::note
Ionic 7 is in beta. Please report any issues on [the Ionic Framework GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework).
:::

:::note
This guide assumes that you have already updated your app to the latest version of Ionic 6. Make sure you have followed the [Upgrading to Ionic 6 Guide](./6-0) before starting this guide.
:::

## Getting Started

### Angular

1. Ionic 7 supports Angular 14+. Update to the latest version of Angular by following the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/).
2. Update to the latest version of Ionic 7:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@next
```

If you are using Ionic Angular Server, be sure to update that as well:

```shell
npm install @ionic/angular@next @ionic/angular-server@next
```

### React

1. Ionic 7 supports React 17+. Update to the latest version of React:

```shell
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

2. Update to the latest version of Ionic 7:

```shell
npm install @ionic/react@next @ionic/react-router@next
```

### Vue

1. Ionic 7 supports Vue 3.0.6+. Update to the latest version of Vue:

```shell
npm install vue@latest vue-router@latest
```

3. Update to the latest version of Ionic 7:

```shell
npm install @ionic/vue@next @ionic/vue-router@next
```

### Core

1. Update to the latest version of Ionic 7:

```shell
npm install @ionic/core@next
```

## Updating Your Code

### Browser Support

The list of browsers that Ionic supports has changed. Review the [Browser Support Guide](../reference/browser-support) to ensure you are deploying apps to supported browsers.

If you have a `browserslist` or `.browserslistrc` file, update it with the following content:

```
Chrome >=79
ChromeAndroid >=79
Firefox >=70
Edge >=79
Safari >=14
iOS >=14
```

### Types

1. `ActionSheetAttributes`, `AlertAttributes`, `AlertTextareaAttributes`, `AlertInputAttributes`, `LoadingAttributes`, `ModalAttributes`, `PickerAttributes`, `PopoverAttributes`, and `ToastAttributes` have been removed. Developers should use `{ [key: string]: any }` instead.


### Checkbox

1. Rename any usages of the `--background` and `--background-checked` CSS Variables to `--checkbox-background` and `--checkbox-background-checked`, respectively.

### Datetime

1. Remove any code that sets the `value` property to the empty string (`''`).
2. Remove any code that accesses the time zone information on the `value` property. Datetime does not manage time zones, so any time zone information provided is ignored.

### Input

1. Update any code that accesses the `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event from `event.detail` to `event.detail.value` as the detail payload is now an object containing a value and an event.

### Modal

1. Remove any usage of the `swipeToClose` property. Use the [canDismiss](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/modal#preventing-a-modal-from-dismissing) property to control when a modal can dismiss.
2. Remove any code that sets the `canDismiss` property to `undefined`. The `canDismiss` property now defaults to `true`, so this code is no longer needed.

### Picker

1. Remove any code that accesses `refresh` on `ion-picker-column`. Developers should use the `columns` property on `ion-picker` to refresh the view instead.

### Searchbar

1. Update any code that accesses the `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event from `event.detail` to `event.detail.value` as the detail payload is now an object containing a value and an event.

### Segment

1. Remove any code that sets the `value` property to `null`. Developers should use either `''` or `undefined` instead.

### Slides

1. Remove `ion-slides`, `ion-slide`, and any associated types. These components have been removed in favor of using Swiper.js directly. The guides below contain more information about this migration:

[Angular Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/slides)<br />
[React Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/slides)<br />
[Vue Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/slides)

### Textarea

1. Update any code that accesses the `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event from `event.detail` to `event.detail.value` as the detail payload is now an object containing a value and an event.


### Toggle

1. Rename any usages of the `--background` and `--background-checked` CSS Variables to `--track-background` and `--track-background-checked`, respectively.

### Virtual Scroll

1. Remove `ion-virtual-scroll` and any associated types. This component has been removed in favor of using virtual scroll solutions provided by JavaScript Frameworks. The guides below contain more information about this migration:

[Angular Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/virtual-scroll)<br />
[React Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/virtual-scroll)<br />
[Vue Migration Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/virtual-scroll)
