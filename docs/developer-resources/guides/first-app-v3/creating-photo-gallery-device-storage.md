# Creating a Photo Gallery with Device Storage

Last time, we successfully added the Camera plugin to the About page of our Tabs app. Currently, the photo is replaced each time a new one is taken. What if we wanted to display multiple photos together? Let’s create a photo gallery. You can follow along with the complete code for this in [the part 2 folder](https://github.com/ionic-team/photo-gallery-tutorial-ionic3/tree/master/part2) on GitHub.

## Creating a Dedicated Photo Service

From a terminal window, navigate to your Ionic project and run:

```shell
ionic g provider PhotoProvider
```

This creates a PhotoProvider class in a dedicated providers/photo folder:

```Javascript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

/*
  Generated class for the PhotoProvider provider.

  See https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection for more info on providers
  and Angular DI.
*/
@Injectable()
export class PhotoProvider {

  constructor(public http: HttpClient) {
    console.log('Hello PhotoProvider Provider');
  }
}
```

Within this class, add a Photo class. The “data” property represents the base64 image data of a captured photo:

```Javascript
class Photo {
  data: any;
}
```

Then, create a Photos array to represent our photo gallery:

```Javascript
export class PhotoProvider {

  public photos: Photo[] = [];

  constructor() { }
}
```

Back in `about.ts`, import PhotoProvider:

```Javascript
import { PhotoProvider } from '../../providers/photo/photo';
```

Add it to the Constructor:

```Javascript
constructor(private camera: Camera, public photoService: PhotoProvider) {  }
```

Next, move all code pertaining to the Camera plugin to the PhotoService class. This includes the takePicture method, the Camera import, and the About page constructor. Also, remove references to HttpClient - we won’t be making any HTTP calls.

Continuing on, we need to convert currentImage variable references to the new photos array. Start by adding the captured photo data into the photos array:

```Javascript
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
    // Add new photo to gallery
    this.photos.unshift({
        data: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData
    }); }, (err) => {
    // Handle error
    console.log("Camera issue: " + err);
});
```

In `about.page.ts`, remove the currentImage variable and the reference to Camera in the constructor, leaving only PhotoService:

```Javascript
export class AboutPage {
  constructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public photoService: PhotoProvider) {  }
}
```

Next, in `about.page.html`, remove the currentImage img tag. In its place, use an ion-grid component, which provides a great way to arrange elements on a page. In this case, we’ll use it to display 2 photos per row.

```html
<ion-grid>
  <ion-row>
    <ion-col col-6 *ngFor="let photo of photoService.photos">
      <img [src]="photo.data" />
    </ion-col>
  </ion-row>
</ion-grid>
```

Here, we loop through each photo in the PhotoServices photos array, adding a new column for each. Since an ion-row consists of 12 “blocks” of space, and we’re setting the size to 6 (“col-6”), only 2 photos are displayed per row.

Last, update the Fab button to call the PhotoProvider’s `takePicture` method:

```Html
<button ion-fab (click)="photoService.takePicture()">
```

Excellent! We now have a basic photo gallery working.

## Saving photos to the device

Having a working photo gallery is pretty cool, but you’ll likely notice that when the app is closed, the photos are lost forever. That’s no good, so let’s add the Ionic Storage plugin, as easy way to store key/value pairs and JSON objects. When running in a native app context, Storage will prioritize using SQLite, one of the most stable and widely used file-based databases. When running on the web or as a Progressive Web App, Storage will attempt to use IndexedDB, WebSQL, and localstorage, in that order.

The Storage plugin works perfectly for our base64 image data. To begin, add the SQLite plugin for native:

```shell
ionic cordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage
```

Next, add the JavaScript library for the web:

```shell
npm install --save @ionic/storage
```

Last, import the Storage module and add it to the imports list in `app.module.ts`:

```Javascript
import { IonicStorageModule } from '@ionic/storage';

imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp),
    IonicStorageModule.forRoot()
  ],
```

It’s now ready to be used in our PhotoProvider class. Import it:

```Javascript
import { Storage } from '@ionic/storage-angular';
```

Then inject it via the constructor:

```Javascript
constructor(private camera: Camera, private storage: Storage) { }
```

To add the capability to save photos, there’s only a couple steps left. Update the `takePicture()` method to save the entire photos array after each photo is taken using the storage.set method:

```Javascript
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
      // Add new photo to gallery
      this.photos.unshift({
        data: 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData
      });

      // Save all photos for later viewing
      this.storage.set('photos', this.photos);
    }, (err) => {
     // Handle error
     console.log("Camera issue: " + err);
    });
```

We still need to load the saved photos when the app is first opened. This is simple enough - retrieve the “photos” key then assign its value to the photos array:

```Javascript
loadSaved() {
    this.storage.get('photos').then((photos) => {
      this.photos = photos || [];
    });
  }
```

Over in the About page, call the loadSaved method once it begins loading:

```Javascript
ngOnInit() {
    this.photoService.loadSaved();
}
```

Sweet! Photos are now saved to your device. To demonstrate that they are indeed being saved, force close DevApp, reopen it, and open the About page. Or, shake your device to have the Control Menu pop up, then tap “Exit preview.” Afterwards, reload this app to view the photos.

Finally, back up your changes to Appflow:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m “implemented photo gallery”
git push ionic master
```

Next up, we’ll look at how to apply a custom theme to an Ionic app.
