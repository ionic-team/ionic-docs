# Getting Started

To create a new Ionic Studio app:

1. Open the New Project modal with **File** &raquo; **New Project**. ![Start a New Project with Studio](/img/studio/2/ss-new-project.png)
2. Supply a name for your app. This can be changed later.
3. Optionally supply a Bundle ID (aka [Package ID](../reference/glossary.md#package-id)), which is used to identify your app when published. It's okay to leave this blank for now.
4. Choose the template you'd like to start with. For a demo of Studio on a real app, choose the sample option (note this is intended only as a demo)
5. Click **Create App**.

## Opening Existing Apps

Ionic Studio supports Ionic Angular 4+ apps. To open an existing app, click "Browse Files" and choose the directory where your app is located.
