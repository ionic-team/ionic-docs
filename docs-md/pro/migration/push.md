# Ionic Push is being Shut Down Jan 31st, 2018

Ionic Push will be shut down and no longer function on January 31st, 2018. To learn more about this shutdown, please read our [blog post](http://blog.ionic.io/sunsetting-ionic-cloud-push-and-auth/).

## Migrating off of Ionic Push

The Ionic community is already using a number of leading push and auth providers today. Here are some linkes & guides on using popular services:

**AWS Pinpoint** has put together a [guide](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/push-notifications-with-ionic-and-amazon-pinpoint/) that shows you exactly how to set up the Pinpoint Push service with an Ionic project.

**OneSignal** offers a free service for Push notifications, learn more [here](https://onesignal.com/ionic).

**Firebase** by Google is also widely used as a push notification service by Ionic users. Check out their docs [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/).
