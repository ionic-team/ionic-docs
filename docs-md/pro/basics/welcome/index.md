# Welcome to Ionic Pro

Ionic Pro is a powerful set of services and features built on top of the flagship Ionic Framework that brings a totally new level of app development agility to mobile dev teams.

Ionic Pro has several core services that help you through the full app lifecycle, including

 * [Deploy](/docs/pro/deploy/): Update your app remotely in real-time without app store delays.
 * [View](/docs/pro/view/): Test your app with testers and get feedback immediately without complicated device and provisioning profile management.
 * [Package](/docs/pro/package/): Build app binaries in the cloud for iOS and Android.
 * [Monitoring](/docs/pro/monitoring/): Track runtime errors in production back to your original TypeScript.

Each one of these services is based around a simple git-based workflow that should be familiar to any app developer.


## Create an Account

To get started with Ionic Pro, first [create an account](https://dashboard.ionicjs.com/signup).

Ionic Pro has a free plan for development and kicking the tires, and paid plans for production app usage. Larger teams can also create Organizations to administer team members and make it easy to manage projects.

## Getting Started

Once your account has been created, continue to the [Installation](/docs/pro/basics/getting-started/) guide to install Pro and link your app to the service.
