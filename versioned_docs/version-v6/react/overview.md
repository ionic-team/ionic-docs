`@ionic/react` brings the full power of the Ionic Framework to React developers. It offers seamless integration with the React ecosystem, so you can build high-quality cross-platform apps using familiar React tools, components, and best practices. You also get access to Ionic's extensive UI library and native capabilities.

## React Version Support

Ionic React supports the latest versions of React. For detailed information on supported versions and our support policy, see the [Ionic React Support Policy](/docs/reference/support#ionic-react).

## React Tooling

Ionic React works seamlessly with the React CLI and popular React tooling. You can use your favorite libraries for state management, testing, and more. Ionic React is designed to fit naturally into the React ecosystem, so you can use tools like Create React App, Vite, or Next.js to scaffold and build your apps.

## Native Tooling

[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) is the official cross-platform runtime for Ionic Angular, enabling your apps to run natively on iOS, Android, and the web with a single codebase.

## Installation

```shell-session
$ npm install -g @ionic/cli
$ ionic start myApp tabs --type react

$ cd myApp
$ ionic serve â–ˆ
```
