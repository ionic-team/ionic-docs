Add native functionality to your app with Capacitor, a native runtime built by the Ionic team. Install of the core packages and add them to your project with ease. Capacitor offers a wide range of features and capabilities that developers can use to access features like the file system, native location services, or the device camera. All of this is powered by a unified TypeScript API that handled platform differences automatically. 

While the core features of Capacitor are free and open source, some enterprises might find them selves needing more features or custom third-party integrations. If you find yourself needing these additional features, checkout [Ionic Enterprise SDK](https://ionic.io/enterprise-sdk).
