`@ionic/angular` combines the core Ionic experience with the tooling and APIs that are tailored to Angular Developers.

## Angular Version Support

Ionic v6 supports Angular v12-v15. As part of their upgrade strategy, Angular has built-in tooling to help automate upgrades and provide feedback to developers whenever changes to an API occurred. This reduces update friction and keeps the ecosystem in a evergreen state.

## Angular Tooling

With Ionic 4+, the official Angular stack for building an app and routing are used, so your app can fall in-line with the rest of the great Angular ecosystem. In cases where more opinionated features are needed, Ionic provides `@ionic/angular-toolkit`, which builds and integrates with the [official Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) and provides features that are specific to `@ionic/angular` apps.
