# Asset Management

The **Assets** section is a quick and easy way to add images or other media to Ionic apps.

  <img alt="Assets" src="/img/studio/2/ss-assets.png" />

The files listed are all contained in the `src/assets` directory, which makes them available in the Ionic app.

## Assets Window

When an element is selected inside of Compose mode that takes `src` as an attribute (such as an `img` tag), the "Choose" button will open the assets window and an asset can be selected for the element attribute.
