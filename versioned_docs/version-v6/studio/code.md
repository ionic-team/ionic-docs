# Working with Code

Ionic Studio works alongside your code editor of choice to enable more complex development workflows
that go beyond Studio's UI development features.

## Launching your Editor

To launch your Studio app project in your editor of choice, navigate to the Designer index and click "Open in editor." Alternatively,
the Project -> Open in Editor menu bar item may be used.

## Configuring your Editor

Studio detects a number of popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and more.

If Studio is not able to detect your editor, ensure that one is installed and configured in the default manner.

Studio will automatically detect one of

- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Visual Studio Code
- WebStorm
- TextMate
- Vim
- NeoVim
- IntelliJ
- GNU nano
- GNU Emacs

## Opening in another editor

If Studio does not automatically detect your editor or your editor is not on the list of supported editors,
the app project can always be opened directly.

To find the project path, use the Project -> Open in Finder (or Explorer) option to navigate to the project
directory on disk and navigate to that path in your editor's project open dialog.
