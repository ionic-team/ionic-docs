The ripple effect component adds the [Material Design ink ripple interaction effect](https://material.io/develop/web/supporting/ripple). This component can only be used inside of an `<ion-app>` and can be added inside of any element.

It's important to set [relative positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) on the parent element because the ripple effect is absolutely positioned and will cover its closest parent that has relative positioning. The parent element should also be given the `ion-activatable` class, which tells the ripple effect that the element is clickable. It's recommended to add `overflow: hidden` to the parent element if the ripple is overflowing its container.


## Basic Usage

## Type

There are two types of ripple effects: `"bounded"` and `"unbounded"`. The default type, `"bounded"`, will expand the ripple effect from the click position outwards. To add a ripple effect that always starts in the center of the element and expands in a circle, set the type to `"unbounded"`.

## Customizing

The ripple can be customized to a different color through CSS. By default the ripple color is set to inherit the text color, which is generally the body color. This can be changed by setting the CSS `color` on the parent or the ripple effect itself.
