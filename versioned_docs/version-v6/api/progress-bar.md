Progress bars inform users about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or saving updates. There are two types of progress bars: `determinate` and `indeterminate`.

## Determinate

Determinate is the default type. It should be used when the percentage of an operation is known. The progress is represented by setting the `value` property. This can be used to show the progress increasing from 0 to 100% of the track.

import Determinate from '@site/static/usage/progress-bar/determinate/index.md';

<Determinate />

### Buffer

If the `buffer` property is set, a buffer stream will show with animated circles to indicate activity. The value of the `buffer` property will also be represented by how much visible track there is. If the value of `buffer` is less than the `value` property, there will be no visible track. If `buffer` is equal to `1` then the buffer stream will be hidden.

import Buffer from '@site/static/usage/progress-bar/buffer/index.md';

<Buffer />


## Indeterminate

The indeterminate type should be used when it is unknown how long the process will take. The progress bar is not tied to the `value`, instead it continually slides along the track until the process is complete.

import Indeterminate from '@site/static/usage/progress-bar/indeterminate/index.md';

<Indeterminate />
