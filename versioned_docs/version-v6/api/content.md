The content component provides an easy to use content area with some useful methods
to control the scrollable area. There should only be one content in a single
view.

Content, along with many other Ionic components, can be customized to modify its padding, margin, and more using the global styles provided in the [CSS Utilities](/docs/layout/css-utilities) or by individually styling it using CSS and the available [CSS Custom Properties](#css-custom-properties).


## Basic Usage

import Basic from '@site/static/usage/content/basic/index.md';

<Basic />


## Header & Footer

Content can be the only top-level component in a page, or it can be used alongside a [header](./header), [footer](./footer), or both. When used with a header or footer, it will adjust its size to fill the remaining height.

import HeaderFooter from '@site/static/usage/content/header-footer/index.md';

<HeaderFooter />


## Fullscreen Content

By default, content fills the space between a [header](./header) and [footer](./footer) but does not go behind them. In certain cases, it may be desired to have the content scroll behind the header and footer, such as when the `translucent` property is set on either of them, or `opacity` is set on the toolbar. This can be achieved by setting the `fullscreen` property on the content to `true`.

import Fullscreen from '@site/static/usage/content/fullscreen/index.md';

<Fullscreen />


## Fixed Content

To place elements outside of the scrollable area, assign them to the `fixed` slot. Doing so will [absolutely position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#absolute_positioning) the element to the top left of the content. In order to change the position of the element, it can be styled using the [top, right, bottom, and left](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) CSS properties.

import Fixed from '@site/static/usage/content/fixed/index.md';

<Fixed />

## Scroll Methods

Content provides [methods](#methods) that can be called to scroll the content to the bottom, top, or to a specific point. They can be passed a `duration` in order to smoothly transition instead of instantly changing the position.

import ScrollMethods from '@site/static/usage/content/scroll-methods/index.md';

<ScrollMethods />

## Scroll Events

Scroll events are disabled by default for content due to performance. However, they can be enabled by setting `scrollEvents` to `true`. This is necessary before listening to any of the scroll [events](#events).

import ScrollEvents from '@site/static/usage/content/scroll-events/index.md';

<ScrollEvents />

## Interfaces

### ScrollBaseDetail

```typescript
interface ScrollBaseDetail {
  isScrolling: boolean;
}
```

### ScrollDetail

```typescript
interface ScrollDetail extends GestureDetail, ScrollBaseDetail {
  scrollTop: number;
  scrollLeft: number;
}
```

### ScrollBaseCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing on the `ionScrollStart` and `ionScrollEnd` events.

```typescript
interface ScrollBaseCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: ScrollBaseDetail;
  target: HTMLIonContentElement;
}
```

### ScrollCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing on the `ionScroll` event.

```typescript
interface ScrollCustomEvent extends ScrollBaseCustomEvent {
  detail: ScrollDetail;
}
```
