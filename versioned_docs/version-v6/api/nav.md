Nav is a standalone component for loading arbitrary components and pushing new components on to the stack.

Unlike Router Outlet, Nav is not tied to a particular router. This means that if we load a Nav component, and push other components to the stack, they will not affect the app's overall router. For example, you should not push a new component to `ion-nav` and expect the URL to update. This fits use cases where you could have a modal, which needs its own sub-navigation, without making it tied to the apps URL.

:::note
`ion-nav` is not meant to be used for routing. Instead, see the routing guides for [Angular](../angular/navigation), [React](../react/navigation), and [Vue](../vue/navigation), or [`ion-router`](./router) for vanilla JavaScript projects.

## Using NavLink

NavLink is a simplified API when interacting with Nav. Developers can customize the component, pass along component properties, modify the direction of the route animation or define a custom animation when navigating.

import NavLinkExample from '@site/static/usage/v6/nav/nav-link/index.md';

<NavLinkExample />

## Interfaces

### NavCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface NavCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  target: HTMLIonNavElement;
}
```
