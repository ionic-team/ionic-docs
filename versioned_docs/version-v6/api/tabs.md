Tabs are a top level navigation component to implement a tab-based navigation.
The component is a container of individual [Tab](tab.md) components.

The `ion-tabs` component does not have any styling and works as a router outlet in order to handle navigation. It does not provide any UI feedback or mechanism to switch between tabs. In order to do so, an `ion-tab-bar` should be provided as a direct child of `ion-tabs`.

Both `ion-tabs` and `ion-tab-bar` can be used as standalone elements. They donâ€™t depend on each other to work, but they are usually used together in order to implement a tab-based navigation that behaves like a native app.

The `ion-tab-bar` needs a slot defined in order to be projected to the right place in an `ion-tabs` component.

:::note Framework Support

Using `ion-tabs` within Angular, React or Vue requires the use of the `ion-router-outlet` or `ion-nav` components.

## Usage with Router

Tabs can be used with the Ionic router to implement tab-based navigation. The tab bar and active tab will automatically resolve based on the url. This is the most common pattern for tabs navigation.

import Router from '@site/static/usage/v6/tabs/router/index.md';

<Router />

:::tip Best Practices

Ionic has guides on best practices for routing patterns with tabs. Check out the guides for [Angular](/angular/navigation#working-with-tabs), [React](/react/navigation#working-with-tabs), and [Vue](/vue/navigation#working-with-tabs) for additional information.

## Interfaces

### TabsCustomEvent

While not required, this interface can be used in place of the `CustomEvent` interface for stronger typing with Ionic events emitted from this component.

```typescript
interface TabsCustomEvent extends CustomEvent {
  detail: { tab: string };
  target: HTMLIonTabsElement;
}
```
