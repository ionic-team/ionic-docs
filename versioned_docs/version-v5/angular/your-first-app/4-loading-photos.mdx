# Loading Photos from the Filesystem

We’ve implemented photo taking and saving to the filesystem. There’s one last piece of functionality missing: the photos are stored in the filesystem, but we need a way to save pointers to each file so that they can be displayed again in the photo gallery.

Fortunately, this is easy: we’ll leverage the Capacitor [Storage API](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/storage) to store our array of Photos in a key-value store.

## Storage API

Begin by defining a constant variable that will act as the key for the store:

```tsx
export class PhotoService {
  public photos: UserPhoto[] = [];
  private PHOTO_STORAGE: string = 'photos';

  // other code
}
```

Next, at the end of the `addNewToGallery` function, add a call to `Storage.set()` to save the Photos array. By adding it here, the Photos array is stored each time a new photo is taken. This way, it doesn’t matter when the app user closes or switches to a different app - all photo data is saved.

```tsx
Storage.set({
  key: this.PHOTO_STORAGE,
  value: JSON.stringify(this.photos),
});
```

With the photo array data saved, create a function called `loadSaved()` that can retrieve that data. We use the same key to retrieve the photos array in JSON format, then parse it into an array:

```tsx
public async loadSaved() {
  // Retrieve cached photo array data
  const photoList = await Storage.get({ key: this.PHOTO_STORAGE });
  this.photos = JSON.parse(photoList.value) || [];

  // more to come...
}
```

On mobile (coming up next!), we can directly set the source of an image tag - `<img src="x" />` - to each photo file on the Filesystem, displaying them automatically. On the web, however, we must read each image from the Filesystem into base64 format, using a new `base64` property on the `Photo` object. This is because the Filesystem API uses [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) under the hood. Below is the code you need to add in the `loadSaved()` function you just added:

```tsx
// Display the photo by reading into base64 format
for (let photo of this.photos) {
  // Read each saved photo's data from the Filesystem
  const readFile = await Filesystem.readFile({
    path: photo.filepath,
    directory: Directory.Data,
  });

  // Web platform only: Load the photo as base64 data
  photo.webviewPath = `data:image/jpeg;base64,${readFile.data}`;
}
```

After, call this new method in `tab2.page.ts` so that when the user first navigates to Tab 2 (the Photo Gallery), all photos are loaded and displayed on the screen.

```tsx
async ngOnInit() {
  await this.photoService.loadSaved();
}
```

That’s it! We’ve built a complete Photo Gallery feature in our Ionic app that works on the web. Next up, we’ll transform it into a mobile app for iOS and Android!
