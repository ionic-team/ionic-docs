# Angular Performance

## \*ngFor with Ionic Components

When using `*ngFor` with Ionic components, we recommend using Angular's `trackBy` option. This allows Angular to manage change propagation in a much more efficient way and only update the content inside of the component rather than re-create the component altogether.

By using `trackBy` you can provide a stable identity for each loop element so Angular can track insertions and deletions within the iterator. Below is an example of how to use `trackBy`:

**home.page.html**

```html
<ion-item *ngFor="let item of items; trackBy:trackItems">
  <ion-label>{{ item.value }}</ion-label>
</ion-item>
```

**home.component.ts**

```tsx

items = [
  { id: 0, value: 'Item 0' },
  { id: 1, value: 'Item 1' },
  ...
]

trackItems(index: number, itemObject: any) {
  return itemObject.id;
}
```

In this example, we have an array of objects called `items`. Each object contains a `value` and an `id`. Using `trackBy`, we pass a `trackItems` function which returns the `id` of each object. This `id` is used to provide a stable identity for each loop element.

For more information on how Angular manages change propagation with `ngFor` see https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf#change-propagation.
