# React Navigation

This guide covers how routing works in an app built with Ionic and React.

`IonReactRouter` uses the popular [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) library under the hood. With Ionic and React Router, you can create multi-page apps with rich page transitions.

Everything you know about routing using React Router carries over into Ionic React. Let's take a look at the basics of an Ionic React app and how routing works with it.

## Routing in Ionic React

Here is a sample `App` component that defines a single route to the "/dashboard" URL. When you visit "/dashboard", the route renders the `DashboardPage` component.

**App.tsx**

```tsx
const App: React.FC = () => (
  <IonApp>
    <IonReactRouter>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route path="/dashboard" component={DashboardPage} />
        <Redirect exact from="/" to="/dashboard" />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonReactRouter>
  </IonApp>
);
```

Directly after the `Route`, we define our default `Redirect`, which, when a user visits the root URL of the app ("/"), it redirects them to the "/dashboard" URL.

The redirect also has the `exact` prop set, which means the URL has to match the `from` prop (or the `path` prop if `exact` was used on a `Route`) precisely for this route to be a match. Without it, this redirect would render for every route, since every route begins with "/".

You can also programmatically redirect from a Route's render method based on a condition, like checking if a user is authed or not:

```tsx
<Route
  exact
  path="/dashboard"
  render={(props) => {
    return isAuthed ? <DashboardPage {...props} /> : <LoginPage />;
  }}
/>
```

## IonReactRouter

The `IonReactRouter` component wraps the traditional [`BrowserRouter`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/BrowserRouter) component from React Router, and sets the app up for routing. Therefore, use `IonReactRouter` in place of `BrowserRouter`. You can pass in any props to `IonReactRouter` and they will be passed down to the underlying `BrowserRouter`.

## Nested Routes

Inside the Dashboard page, we define more routes related to this specific section of the app:

**DashboardPage.tsx**

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route exact path="/dashboard" component={UsersListPage} />
        <Route path="/dashboard/users/:id" component={UserDetailPage} />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Here, there are a couple more routes defined to point to pages from within the dashboard portion of the app. Note, that we need to define the whole route in the path, and we can't leave off "/dashboard" even though we arrived to this page from that URL. React Router requires full paths, and relative paths are not supported.

However, we can use the [`match`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match) objects `url` property to provide the URL that was matched to render a component, which helps when working with nested routes:

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonRouterOutlet>
        <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
        <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      </IonRouterOutlet>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Here, `match.url` contains the value of "/dashboard", since that was the URL used to render the `DashboardPage`.

These routes are grouped in an `IonRouterOutlet`, let's discuss that next.

## IonRouterOutlet

The `IonRouterOutlet` component provides a container for Routes that render Ionic "pages". When a page is in an `IonRouterOutlet`, the container controls the transition animation between the pages as well as controls when a page is created and destroyed, which helps maintain the state between the views when switching back and forth between them.

The `DashboardPage` above shows a users list page and a details page. When navigating between the two pages, the `IonRouterOutlet` provides the appropriate platform page transition and keeps the state of the previous page intact so that when a user navigates back to the list page, it appears in the same state as when it left.

An `IonRouterOutlet` should only contain `Route`s or `Redirect`s. Any other component should be rendered either as a result of a `Route` or outside of the `IonRouterOutlet`.

## Fallback Route

A common routing use case is to provide a "fallback" route to be rendered in the event the location navigated to does not match any of the routes defined.

We can define a fallback route by placing a `Route` component without a `path` property as the last route defined within an `IonRouterOutlet`.

**DashboardPage.tsx**

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
      <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      <Route render={() => <Redirect to={match.url} />} />
    </IonRouterOutlet>
  );
};
```

Here, we see that in the event a location does not match the first two `Route`s the `IonRouterOutlet` will redirect the Ionic React app to the `match.url` path.

You can alternatively supply a component to render instead of providing a redirect.

```tsx
const DashboardPage: React.FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonRouterOutlet>
      <Route exact path={match.url} component={UsersListPage} />
      <Route path={`${match.url}/users/:id`} component={UserDetailPage} />
      <Route component={NotFoundPage} />
    </IonRouterOutlet>
  );
};
```

## IonPage

The `IonPage` component wraps each view in an Ionic React app and allows page transitions and stack navigation to work properly. Each view that is navigated to using the router must include an `IonPage` component.

```tsx
import { IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';
import React from 'react';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Home</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent className="ion-padding">Hello World</IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
export default Home;
```

## Navigation

There are several options available when routing to different views in an Ionic React app. Here, the `UsersListPage` uses `IonItem`'s `routerLink` prop to specify the route to go to when the item is tapped/clicked:

**UsersListPage.tsx**

```tsx
const UsersListPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>Users</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent>
        <IonList>
          <IonItem routerLink="/dashboard/users/1">
            <IonLabel>User 1</IonLabel>
          </IonItem>
          <IonItem routerLink="/dashboard/users/2">
            <IonLabel>User 2</IonLabel>
          </IonItem>
        </IonList>
      </IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

Other components that have the `routerLink` prop are `IonButton`, `IonCard`, `IonRouterLink`, `IonFabButton`, and `IonItemOption`.

Each of these components also have a `routerDirection` prop to explicitly set the type of page transition to use ("back", "forward", or "none").

Outside of these components that have the `routerLink` prop, you can also use React Routers [`Link`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link) component to navigate between views:

```html
<Link to="/dashboard/users/1">User 1</Link>
```

We recommend using one of the above methods whenever possible for routing. The advantage to these approaches is that they both render an anchor (`<a>`)tag, which is suitable for overall app accessibility.

A programmatic option for navigation is using the [`history`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/history) prop that React Router provides to the components it renders via routes.

```tsx
<IonButton
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    history.push('/dashboard/users/1');
  }}
>
  Go to User 1
</IonButton>
```

:::note
`history` is a prop.
:::

## URL Parameters

The second route defined in the Dashboard Page has a URL parameter defined (the ":id" portion in the path). URL parameters are dynamic portions of the `path`, and when the user navigates to a URL such as "/dashboard/users/1", the "1" is saved to a parameter named "id", which can be accessed in the component the route renders. Let's see how that's done.

**UserDetailPage.tsx**

```tsx
interface UserDetailPageProps
  extends RouteComponentProps<{
    id: string;
  }> {}

const UserDetailPage: React.FC<UserDetailPageProps> = ({ match }) => {
  return (
    <IonPage>
      <IonHeader>
        <IonToolbar>
          <IonTitle>User Detail</IonTitle>
        </IonToolbar>
      </IonHeader>
      <IonContent>User {match.params.id}</IonContent>
    </IonPage>
  );
};
```

The [`match`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match) prop contains information about the matched route, including the URL params. We obtain the `id` param here and display it on the screen.

Note how we use a TypeScript interface to strongly type the props object. The interface gives us type safety and code completion inside of the component.

## Live Example

If you would prefer to get hands on with the concepts and code described above, please checkout our [live example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ionic-react-routing?file=src/index.tsx) of the topics above on StackBlitz.

### IonRouterOutlet in a Tabs View

When working in a tabs view, Ionic React needs a way to determine what views belong to which tabs. We accomplish this by taking advantage of the fact that the paths provided to a `Route` are regular expressions.

While the syntax looks a bit strange, it is reasonably straightforward once you understand it.

For example, the routes for a view with two tabs (sessions and speakers) can be set up as such:

```tsx
<IonRouterOutlet>
  <Route path="/:tab(sessions)" component={SessionsPage} exact={true} />
  <Route path="/:tab(sessions)/:id" component={SessionDetail} />
  <Route path="/:tab(speakers)" component={SpeakerList} exact={true} />
</IonRouterOutlet>
```

If the navigated URL were "/sessions", it would match the first route and add a URL parameter named "tab" with the value of "sessions" to the resulting `match` object passed into `SessionsPage`.

When a user navigates to a session detail page ("/sessions/1" for instance), the second route adds a URL parameter named "tab" with a value of "sessions". When `IonRouterOutlet` sees that both pages are in the same "sessions" tab, it provides an animated page transition to the new view. If a user navigates to a new tab ("speakers" in this case), `IonRouterOutlet` knows not to provide the animation.

### Switches in IonRouterOutlet

Since `IonRouterOutlet` takes over the job in determining which routes get rendered, using a `Switch` from React Router has no effect when used inside of an `IonRouterOutlet`. Switches still function as expected when used outside an `IonRouterOutlet`.
