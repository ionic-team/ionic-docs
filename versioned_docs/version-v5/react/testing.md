# Testing Ionic React

When an `@ionic/react` application is generated using the Ionic CLI, it is automatically set up for unit testing and integration testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro). The combo provides a great way to test your React components in isolation as well integrated together. For more information on how to get started testing an Ionic React app, see our article [Testing Ionic React Apps with Jest and React Testing Library](https://ionicframework.com/blog/testing-ionic-react-apps-with-jest-and-react-testing-library/).
