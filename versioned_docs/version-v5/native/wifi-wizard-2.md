# WifiWizard2

WifiWizard2 enables Wifi management for both Android and iOS applications within Cordova/Phonegap projects.

This project is a fork of the WifiWizard plugin with fixes and updates, as well as patches taken from the Cordova Network Manager plugin.

## Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS

## Usage

### React

[Learn more about using Ionic Native components in React](../native-community.md#react)

### Angular

````tsx
import { WifiWizard2 } from '@awesome-cordova-plugins/wifi-wizard-2/ngx';


constructor(private wifiWizard2: WifiWizard2) { }


# Global Functions
 These are functions that can be used by both Android and iOS applications
 ```tsx
 this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedSSID()
````

- Returns connected network SSID (only if connected) in success callback, otherwise fail callback will be called (if not connected or unable to retrieve)
- This does **NOT** return the BSSID if unable to obtain SSID (like original WifiWizard did)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedBSSID();
```

- Same as above, except BSSID (mac) is returned

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.timeout(delay);
```

- `delay` should be time in milliseconds to delay
- Helper async timeout delay, `delay` is optional, default is 2000ms = 2 seconds
- This method always returns a resolved promise after the delay, it will never reject or throw an error

**Example inside async function**

```tsx
async function example() {
  await this.wifiWizard2.timeout(4000);
  // do something after 4 seconds
}
```

**Example inside standard non-async function**

```tsx
function example(){
   this.wifiWizard2.timeout(4000).then( function(){
       // do something after waiting 4 seconds
   }):
}
```

**Thrown Errors**

- `TIMEOUT_WAITING_FOR_SCAN` on timeout waiting for scan 10 seconds +
- `SCAN_FAILED` if unable to start scan

# iOS Functions

For functionality, you need to note the following:

- Connect/Disconnect only works for iOS11+
- Can't run in the simulator so you need to attach an actual device when building with xCode
- Will ensure 'HotspotConfiguration' and 'NetworkExtensions' capabilities are added to your xCode project
- To connect to open network omit `ssidPassword` or call with `false`

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.iOSConnectNetwork(ssid, ssidPassword);
```

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.iOSDisconnectNetwork(ssid);
```

# Android Functions

- **WifiWizard2** _will automagically try to enable WiFi if it's disabled when calling any android related methods that require WiFi to be enabled_

## Connect vs Enable

When writing Android Java code, there is no `connect` methods, you basically either `enable` or `disable` a network. In the original versions of WifiWizard the `connect` method would basically just call `enable` in Android.
I have changed the way this works in WifiWizard2 version 3.0.0+, converting it to a helper method to eliminate having to call `formatWifiConfig` then `add` and then `enable` ... the `connect` method will now automatically call `formatWifiConfig`, then call `add` to either add or update the network configuration, and then call `enable`.
If the connect method is unable to update existing network configuration (added by user or other apps), but there is a valid network ID, it will still attempt to enable that network ID.

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.connect(ssid, bindAll, password, algorithm, isHiddenSSID);
```

- `ssid` should be the SSID to connect to _required_
- `bindAll` should be set to `true` to tell Android to route all connections from your Android app, through the wifi connection (default is `false`) _optional_
- See `WifiWizard2.enable` for more details regarding `bindAll` feature
- `algorithm` and `password` is not required if connecting to an open network
- Currently `WPA` and `WEP` are only supported algorithms
- For `WPA2` just pass `WPA` as the algorithm
- Set `isHiddenSSID` to `true` if the network you're connecting to is hidden
- These arguments are the same as for `formatWifiConfig`
- This method essentially calls `formatWifiConfig` then `add` then `enable`
- If unable to update network configuration (was added by user or other app), but a valid network ID exists, this method will still attempt to enable the network
- Promise will not be returned until method has verified that connection to WiFi was in completed state (waits up to 60 seconds)

**Thrown Errors**

- `CONNECT_FAILED_TIMEOUT` unable to verify connection, timed out after 60 seconds
- `INVALID_NETWORK_ID_TO_CONNECT` Unable to connect based on generated wifi config
- `INTERPUT_EXCEPT_WHILE_CONNECTING` Interupt exception while waiting for connection

## Disconnect vs Disable

Same as above for Connect vs Enable, except in this situation, `disconnect` will first disable the network, and then attempt to remove it (if SSID is passed)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.disconnect(ssid);
```

- `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
- `ssid` is **OPTIONAL** .. if not passed, will disconnect current WiFi (almost all Android versions now will just automatically reconnect to last wifi after disconnecting)
- If `ssid` is provided, this method will first attempt to `disable` and then `remove` the network
- If you do not want to remove network configuration, use `disable` instead

**Thrown Errors**

- `DISCONNECT_NET_REMOVE_ERROR` Android returned error when removing wifi configuration
- `DISCONNECT_NET_DISABLE_ERROR` Unable to connect based on generated wifi config
- `DISCONNECT_NET_ID_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID to disconnect/remove (from passed SSID)
- `ERROR_DISCONNECT` - Android error disconnecting wifi (only when SSID is not passed)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.formatWifiConfig(ssid, password, algorithm, isHiddenSSID);
```

- `algorithm` and `password` is not required if connecting to an open network
- Currently `WPA` and `WEP` are only supported algorithms
- For `WPA2` just pass `WPA` as the algorithm
- Set `isHiddenSSID` to `true` if the network you're connecting to is hidden

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.formatWPAConfig(ssid, password, isHiddenSSID);
```

- This is just a helper method that calls `WifiWizard2.formatWifiConfig( ssid, password, 'WPA', isHiddenSSID );`

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.add(wifi);
```

- `wifi` must be an object formatted by `formatWifiConfig`, this **must** be done before calling `enable`

**Thrown Errors**

- `AUTH_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED` - Invalid auth type specified
- `ERROR_ADDING_NETWORK` - Android returned `-1` specifying error adding network
- `ERROR_UPDATING_NETWORK` - Same as above, except an existing network ID was found, and unable to update it

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.remove(ssid);
```

- `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
- Please note, most newer versions of Android will only allow wifi to be removed if created by your application

**Thrown Errors**

- `UNABLE_TO_REMOVE` Android returned failure in removing network
- `REMOVE_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID from passed SSID

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.listNetworks();
```

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.scan([options]);
```

- Same as calling `startScan` and then `getScanResults`, except this method will only resolve the promise after the scan completes and returns the results.

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.startScan();
```

- It is recommended to just use the `scan` method instead of `startScan`

**Thrown Errors**

- `STARTSCAN_FAILED` Android returned failure in starting scan

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.getScanResults([options]);
```

- `getScanResults` should only be called after calling `startScan` (it is recommended to use `scan` instead as this starts the scan, then returns the results)
- `[options]` is optional, if you do not want to specify, just pass `success` callback as first parameter, and `fail` callback as second parameter
- Retrieves a list of the available networks as an array of objects and passes them to the function listHandler. The format of the array is:

```tsx
networks = [
{   "level": signal_level, // raw RSSI value
       "SSID": ssid, // SSID as string, with escaped double quotes: "\"ssid name\""
       "BSSID": bssid // MAC address of WiFi router as string
       "frequency": frequency of the access point channel in MHz
       "capabilities": capabilities // Describes the authentication, key management, and encryption schemes supported by the access point.
       "timestamp": timestamp // timestamp of when the scan was completed
       "channelWidth":
       "centerFreq0":
       "centerFreq1":
   }
]
```

- `channelWidth` `centerFreq0` and `centerFreq1` are only supported on API > 23 (Marshmallow), any older API will return null for these values

An options object may be passed. Currently, the only supported option is `numLevels`, and it has the following behavior:

- if `(n == true || n &lt; 2)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will return data as before, split in 5 levels;
- if `(n > 1)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will calculate the signal level, split in n levels;
- if `(n == false)`, `*.getScanResults({numLevels: n})` will use the raw signal level;

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.isWifiEnabled();
```

- Returns boolean value of whether Wifi is enabled or not

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.setWifiEnabled(enabled);
```

- Pass `true` for `enabled` parameter to set Wifi enabled
- You do not need to call this function to set WiFi enabled to call other methods that require wifi enabled. This plugin will automagically enable WiFi if a method is called that requires WiFi to be enabled.

**Thrown Errors**

- `ERROR_SETWIFIENABLED` wifi state does not match call (enable or disable)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.getConnectedNetworkID();
```

- Returns currently connected network ID in success callback (only if connected), otherwise fail callback will be called

**Thrown Errors**

- `GET_CONNECTED_NET_ID_ERROR` Unable to determine currently connected network ID (may not be connected)

## New to 3.1.1+

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.resetBindAll();
```

- Disable bindAll to WiFi network without disconnecting from WiFi

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.setBindAll();
```

- Enable bindAll to WiFi network without disconnecting from WiFi

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.canConnectToInternet();
```

- Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to connect to https://www.google.com via HTTP connection (since ping is unreliable)
- Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
- If you called `connect` or `enable` and passed `true` for `bindAll`, your application will force the ping through wifi connection.
- If you did not pass `true` (or passed `false`) for `bindAll`, and the wifi does not have internet connection, Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will use cell connection to ping (due to Android using cell connection when wifi does not have internet) [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.canConnectToRouter();
```

- As `canPingWifiRouter` is notoriously unreliable, this method uses HTTP connection to test if able to connect to router (as most routers should have web server running on port 80)
- Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
- This is useful for testing to make sure that your Android app is able to connect to the private network after connecting to WiFi
- This was added for testing the `bindAll` feature to support issues with Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) not routing calls through WiFi if WiFi does not have internet connection [See Android Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)
- Attempts to connect router IP HTTP server on port 80 (example: `http://192.168.0.1/` where `192.168.0.1` is the automatically detected IP address)

## New to 3.0.0+

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.isConnectedToInternet();
```

- Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to ping 8.8.8.8
- Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
- If you called `connect` or `enable` and passed `true` for `bindAll`, your application will force the ping through wifi connection.
- If you did not pass `true` (or passed `false`) for `bindAll`, and the wifi does not have internet connection, Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will use cell connection to ping (due to Android using cell connection when wifi does not have internet) [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.canPingWifiRouter();
```

- Returns boolean, true or false, if device is able to ping the connected WiFi router IP (obtained from DHCP info)
- Version 3.1.1+ uses HTTP connection to test if able to connect to router (as ping previous did not work)
- Unknown errors will still be thrown like all other async functions
- This is useful for testing to make sure that your Android app is able to connect to the private network after connecting to WiFi
- This was added for testing the `bindAll` feature to support issues with Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) not routing calls through WiFi if WiFi does not have internet connection [See Android Blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.enableWifi();
```

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.disableWifi();
```

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.getWifiIP();
```

- Returns IPv4 address of currently connected WiFi, or rejects promise if IP not found or wifi not connected

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.getWifiRouterIP();
```

- Returns IPv4 WiFi router IP from currently connected WiFi, or rejects promise if unable to determine, or wifi not connected

**Thrown Errors**

- `NO_VALID_IP_IDENTIFIED` if unable to determine a valid IP (ip returned from device is `0.0.0.0`)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.getWifiIPInfo();
```

- Returns a JSON object with IPv4 address and subnet `{"ip": "192.168.1.2", "subnet": "255.255.255.0" }` or rejected promise if not found or not connected
  **Thrown Errors**

- `NO_VALID_IP_IDENTIFIED` if unable to determine a valid IP (ip returned from device is `0.0.0.0`)

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.reconnect();
```

- Reconnect to the currently active access point, **if we are currently disconnected.**

**Thrown Errors**

- `ERROR_RECONNECT` Android returned error when reconnecting

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.reassociate();
```

- Reconnect to the currently active access point, **even if we are already connected.**

**Thrown Errors**

- `ERROR_REASSOCIATE` Android returned error when reassociating

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.getSSIDNetworkID(ssid);
```

- Get Android Network ID from passed SSID

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.disable(ssid);
```

- `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
- Disable the passed SSID network
- Please note that most newer versions of Android will only allow you to disable networks created by your application

**Thrown Errors**

- `UNABLE_TO_DISABLE` Android returned failure in disabling network
- `DISABLE_NETWORK_NOT_FOUND` Unable to determine network ID from passed SSID to disable

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.requestPermission();
```

- Request `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permssion
- This Android permission is required to run `scan`, `startStart` and `getScanResults`
- You can request permission by running this function manually, or WifiWizard2 will automagically request permission when one of the functions above is called

**Thrown Errors**

- `PERMISSION_DENIED` user denied permission on device

```tsx
this.wifiWizard2.enable(ssid, bindAll, waitForConnection);
```

- `ssid` can either be an SSID (string) or a network ID (integer)
- `bindAll` should be set to `true` to tell Android to route all connections from your Android app, through the wifi connection
- Android Lollipop+ (API 21+) will not route connections to the WiFi device if it does not have internet connection. Passing `true` to `bindAll` will force Android to route connections from your Android app through Wifi, regardless of internet connection.
- If you are having problems connecting to a local IP through WiFi because it does not have internet, try enabling `bindAll` and this should fix the problem.
- During my testing, some versions of Android (5.0 - 7.1.2) would still route connections through WiFi without internet, but it was random that some versions would and would not work.
- Testing Android Oreo+ (8.0.0+) if wifi does not have internet, 100% of the time it would NOT route connections through WiFi, so you _must_ enable this for Oreo or newer to route connections from your application through wifi without internet.
- When `bindAll` is enabled, _ALL_ connections from your app will be routed through WiFi, until you call `disconnect` or `disable`
- See the Google Android Blog for [More Details](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/connecting-your-app-to-wi-fi-device.html)
- This feature _ONLY_ works for Android Lollipop+ (API 21+), if device is running API older than 21, `bindall` will be ignored (as API older than 21 does this by default)
- Enable the passed SSID network
- You **MUST** call `WifiWizard2.add(wifi)` before calling `enable` as the wifi configuration must exist before you can enable it (or previously used `connect` without calling `disconnect`)
- This method does NOT wait or verify connection to wifi network, pass `true` to `waitForConnection` to only return promise once connection is verified in COMPLETED state to specific `ssid`

**Thrown Errors**

`UNABLE_TO_ENABLE` - Android returned `-1` signifying failure enabling
