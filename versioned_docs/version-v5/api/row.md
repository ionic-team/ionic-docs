# ion-row

Rows are horizontal components of the [grid](grid.md) system and contain varying numbers of
[columns](col.md). They ensure the columns are positioned properly.

See [Grid Layout](../layout/grid.md) for more information.

## Row Alignment

By default, columns will stretch to fill the entire height of the row and wrap when necessary. Rows are [flex containers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Container), so there are several [CSS classes](../layout/css-utilities.md#flex-container-properties) that can be applied to a row to customize this behavior.
