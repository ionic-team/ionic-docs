# ionic ssh setup

Setup your Ionic SSH keys automatically

```shell
ionic ssh setup [options]
```

This command offers a setup wizard for Ionic SSH keys using a series of prompts. For more control, see the commands available for managing SSH keys with the `ionic ssh --help` command. For an entirely manual approach, see **Personal Settings** => **SSH Keys** in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/settings/ssh-keys).

If you are having issues setting up SSH keys, please get in touch with our [Support](https://ion.link/support-request).
