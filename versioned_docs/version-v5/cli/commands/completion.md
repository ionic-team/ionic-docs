# ionic completion

Enables tab-completion for Ionic CLI commands.

```shell
$ ionic completion [options]
```

This command is experimental and only works for Z shell (zsh) and non-Windows platforms.

To enable completions for the Ionic CLI, you can add the completion code that this command prints to your **~/.zshrc** (or any other file loaded with your shell). See the examples.

## Examples

```shell
$ ionic completion
$ ionic completion >> ~/.zshrc
```
