# ionic git remote

Adds/updates the Appflow git remote to your local Ionic app

```shell
$ ionic git remote [options]
```

This command is used by `ionic link` when Appflow is used as the git host.

`ionic git remote` will check the local repository for whether or not the git remote is properly set up. This command operates on the **ionic** remote. For advanced configuration, see **Settings** => **Git** in the app settings of the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com).
