# Data Storage

There are variety of options available for storing data within an Ionic app.

Here are two official Ionic options:

## Ionic Secure Storage

For teams building mission-critical apps or requiring encryption support, [Ionic Secure Storage](https://ionic.io/docs/secure-storage) is an official premium solution from the Ionic team that provides a cross-platform data storage system that works on iOS and Android.

It makes it easy to build high performance, offline-ready Ionic apps across iOS, Android, and the web.

## @ionic/storage

For developers not requiring encryption nor relational data support, [@ionic/storage](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-storage) is an open source key/value API for building apps that work across storage engines on multiple platforms.

Additionally, Ionic Secure Storage has a driver that works with the key/value API in `@ionic/storage` while providing encryption and SQLite support.
