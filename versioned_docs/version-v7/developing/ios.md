:::info Looking for the legacy iOS guide?

The Developing for iOS guide has officially migrated to the [Capacitor documentation for iOS](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios). If you need to access the legacy documentation, you can find it under the [legacy developing for iOS guide](https://ionic-docs-o31kiyk8l-ionic1.vercel.app/docs/v6/developing/ios).
