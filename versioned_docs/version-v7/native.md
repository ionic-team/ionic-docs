Add native functionality to your app with Capacitor, a native runtime built by the Ionic team. Install the core packages and easily add them to your project. Capacitor has a wide range of capabilities that developers can use to access features like the device file system, camera, and native location services. All of this is powered by a unified TypeScript API that automatically handles platform differences.

While the core features of Capacitor are free and open source, some enterprises might find themselves needing more features or custom third-party integrations. If you need such additional features, check out the [Ionic Enterprise SDK](https://ionic.io/enterprise-sdk).
