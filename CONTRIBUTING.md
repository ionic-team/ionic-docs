## Development Workflow

In order to run the documentation locally, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

> **Note**: recent versions of npm (5+) and Node.js (8+) are required to run certain scripts.

---

## Project Structure

Ionic's documentation is built using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com). The content is written as Markdown or pulled in as JSON data from other Ionic repositories.

At a high level, the production documentation works like this:

1. At build time, the `build-pages` script reads the Markdown in `src/pages/` and creates a JSON representation of each page at the same path
   ```
   pages/
   ├── intro.json
   └── intro.md
   ```
2. At runtime, the `docs-page` component receives the current path (e.g. `/docs/intro`)
3. The `docs-page` component fetches and parses the [JSON representation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/pages/intro.json) of that page
4. The `docs-page` component renders that data using a [template](/components/page/templates)

> **Note**: most reference content (e.g. APIs, native plugins, CLI commands) is not stored as Markdown. Those pages are created using data provided by other repositories to the `build-pages` script.

### Directories

- `scripts/` - build scripts used to generate JSON representations of each page and other data used in the docs
- `src/` - source code and content of the docs
  - `assets/` - static assets used on the site, like images and fonts
  - `components/` - Stencil components used in the documentation UI
  - `demos/` - Self-contained demos, optionally presented by pages via `demoUrl` YAML frontmatter
  - `pages/` - Markdown content organized by route and uncommitted JSON representation of each page
  - `styles/` - Global and page-specific styles (non-component styles)

### Page Templates

The [`docs-page`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/blob/master/src/components/page/page.tsx) component is responsible for loading and rendering page content. Page content is rendered using one of the templates exported [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/blob/master/src/components/page/templates/index.ts). Pages can specify a template via the `template` key in their frontmatter, or the default template will be used.

```tsx
const Template = templates[page.template] || template.default;
return <Template page={page} />;
```

### Menu Templates

The [`docs-menu`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/blob/master/src/components/menu/menu.tsx) component is responsible for rendering the side menu. The menu content differs by path and is specified in [per-section templates](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/tree/master/src/components/menu/templates).

---

## Authoring Content

The content of the Ionic docs is written as [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) in `src/pages`. Each Markdown file corresponds to a route.

```
/docs/intro             =>  src/pages/intro.md
/docs/installation/cli  =>  src/pages/installation/cli.md
/docs/theming/advanced  =>  src/pages/theming/advanced.md
/docs/theming           =>  src/pages/theming.md
```

You can make copy edits to the site by [editing the Markdown files directly on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/). In your pull request, please explain what was missing from or inaccurate about the content.

### Authoring Locally

To edit or create content locally, you'll need to [run the development server](#development-workflow). By default, the pages are only built once while starting the server. You can rebuild the pages continuously as you edit them by concurrently running the `watch-pages` script:

```sh
$ npm run watch-pages
```

> **Note**: the `watch-pages` script won't reload the page. You will need to reload the page manually after your page is rebuilt.

### Reference Content

The Markdown in `src/pages` does not contain all of the Ionic documentation's content:

- Paths matching `/docs/api/*` are built from the [Ionic Framework](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic) source code
- Paths matching `/docs/native/*` are built from the [Ionic Native](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native) source code
- Paths matching `/docs/cli/commands/*` are built from the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) source code

## Translation

The Ionic docs have been translated into Japanese and are in the process of being translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We've chosen these languages because we believe they have the greatest number of developers where English-only documentation would be a barrier.

We use Crowdin for our translation service. You can participate in the translation effort on the [Ionic Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/ionic-docs).

_Please submit translation issues to the Crowdin page and not the Ionic Docs GitHub repo_

The Japanese translation of the docs were built by an independent team, lead by [rdlabo](https://github.com/rdlabo) and can be found and contributed to on the [ionic-jp group's `ionic-docs` project page](https://github.com/ionic-jp/ionic-docs).

### Add new pages / Updating sidebar menus

When adding new pages to the docs, add a new token representing the page name to the appropriate Menu template (`src/components/menu/templates`).

For example, in `src/components/menu/templates/main.tsx`:

```javascript
// 'token': 'path'
'menu-installation-cli': '/docs/installation/cli',
```

Then, add the token and its translation to each file within the `src/assets/locales` folder:

For example, in `src/assets/locales/en/messages.json`:

```javascript
// 'token': 'translated text'
"menu-installation-cli": "CLI Installation",
```

## Reporting Issues

Before submitting an issue to the Ionic docs repo, please search [existing issues](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/issues) to avoid duplicate reports.

If the issue you're reporting is a bug, please be sure it is an issue with the Ionic docs themselves and not the subject of the documentation. With your report, please provide:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- OS and browser versions
- If possible, a demo repo or CodePen/CodeSandbox

> **Note**: Some [reference content](#reference-content) is pulled from other Ionic repos. In that case, please submit your issue on the docs repo with a link to the repo where the content lives.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting pull requests, please keep the scope of your change contained to a single feature or bug. When in doubt, err on the side of smaller pull requests. If your pull request is a new feature, we would recommend opening an issue first to come to an agreement about the feature before putting in significant time.

> **Note**: `tslint` will run automatically when you attempt to commit. Our lint rules extend [tslint-ionic-rules](https://github.com/ionic-team/tslint-ionic-rules).

---

## Project Management

Internally, the Ionic documentation team uses a [project board](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/projects/3) to plan work on the docs. The lanes on the board are:

- **Backlog** :file_cabinet: - Issues we plan to address, generally sorted by urgency
- **On Deck** :baseball: - Issues to be addressed during the current sprint, pulled from backlog during sprint planning
- **In Progress** :hammer: - Assigned issues that are currently being addressed
- **Needs Review** :mag: - Pull requests and issues that have a pending review
- **Done** :tada: - Issues that have been resolved

If you're looking for issues to help out with, we'd recommend either asking about an issue in the backlog or checking for issues labeled [`help-wanted`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/labels/help%20wanted).

---

## Deploying

The Ionic documentation's `master` branch is deployed automatically and separately from the [Ionic site](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-site) itself. The Ionic site then uses a proxy for paths under `/docs` to request the deployed documentation.
